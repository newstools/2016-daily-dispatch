Taking to Instagram‚ Speedy lambasted everyone who has mocked him for always carrying a towel over his left shoulder and urged people to rather do their research instead of criticising him for the trend‚ which he has adopted from music legends in the US. “With everyone back in SA sweating me for carrying a towel. Legends like KCI and JOJO‚ @sisqo and @rkelly been on that swagg long before I started my career‚” he captioned the snap of K-Ci & JoJo‚ an American R& B duo‚ with towels over their shoulders during an interview. “Now you know I learned from the best. Some people just need to stop being dumb and ignorant just because you don’t understand something it don’t mean you gotta criticize just simply research‚” he added.
