This weeks planned inquiry into the fitness of the remaining members of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board to hold office has been pushed back even further. Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Communications announced on Tuesday that the probe which was to start on Wednesday would go ahead next week .But later on Wednesday the committee said it is committed to proceeding with the inquiry at its earliest convenience and envisages to finalise the inquiry before the last plenary of the National Assembly scheduled for the 24 of November 2016 . The committee hopes to serve members of the board with the notice of hearing by no later than Friday 28 October 2016 it said in a statement.It noted that the committee having sought and obtained legal advice on the due process resolved to abide by the rules of natural justice .The inquiry was ordered after defiant members of the board defended the appointment of former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive of corporate affairs at an appearance before the committee earlier this month.That appointment is being challenged in court by the Democratic Alliance which is also asking for it to make a determination of the suitability of the incumbent board and proffer legal certainty on how the board is to be dissolved and a new one appointed .The party s James Selfe said the parliamentary probe would reveal the full scope of its malfeasance to the public after board chairperson Prof Maguvhe Mbulaheni had after meeting the committee made it clear that he would not do the honourable thing by acceding to the portfolio committee on communication s request that the board resign with immediate effect .Two non-executive members of the board Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso tendered their resignations during that committee meeting which rendered the board without a quorum.
