Two gun-toting men have held up a patient inside the waiting room of a clinic in Kwazakhele Port Elizabeth in the latest crime to affect public health facilities prompting a call for increased security. Celeste Barker an Eastern Cape MPL said the crime highlighted inadequate security at clinics in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. She said the attack at the Kwazakhele clinic happened on Monday in lunchtime. They stole the patient s car keys helped themselves to his vehicle and drove off with his phone his wallet and the contents of his car. Barker listed other cases she was aware of as:&#8211; Four robberies at the New Brighton Clinic in September;&#8211; A stabbing inside the Veeplaas Clinic in August;&#8211; Robbery and alleged assault at the Zwide Clinic in July. Such behaviour is completely unacceptable. It is &#8230; out of place in a building devoted to healthcare and a major fear factor for staff and fragile patients weakened by disease and pain. She called for funds to be allocated to ensure sufficient 24-hour security at clinics.
