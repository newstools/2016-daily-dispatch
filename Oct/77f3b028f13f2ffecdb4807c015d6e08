Dozens of people from Rhodes University yesterday gathered to add their voices to a national call for a properly funded, quality, transformative higher education. Academics, administrative, management and other staff, representatives of unions and some students stood in front of the Drostdy Arch sporting banners calling for unity in education, a free, quality education for the poor and proper government funding.There was a small police presence as they stood together under the arch.Vice-chancellor Sizwe Mabizela who was once a professor of mathematics carried a banner which read Mathematics for all .There was laughter as a professor from the humanities department pretended to inspect the former mathematician s banner for spelling mistakes.Meanwhile, talks about talks between the university management and some stakeholders including protesting students resumed yesterday morning.The students demand that they get a blanket amnesty for all actions during the protest remained a sticking point.The talks are expected to go on into the weekend.Lecturing has continued at Rhodes, although some disruptions including the setting off of fire-alarms and releasing toxic fire-extinguishers in lecture halls have stalled the full implementation of the academic programme.Mabizela yesterday sent out a communiqu to parents saying the university s highest priority remained the successful completion of the 2016 academic year.With this in mind, lectures were continuing even though some were being disrupted, he said. Learning materials were being made available online and academic staff were available at all times for consultation and guidance, he added.
