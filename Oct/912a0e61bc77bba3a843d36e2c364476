Mdantsane-born bodybuilders Thembelani Dlodlo and Bulelani Jola will flex their muscles at the world championships in Ireland next month. Dlodlo, 34, a fitness instructor at Body Culture in Beacon Bay, where Jola is a member, said the journey to the top of the sport was hard work and a financial strain.National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (Nabba) champion Dlodlo, who has been training for seven years, said his career escalated when he joined Body Culture, which is managed by former Border bodybuilding champion Michael Ott. It helps to work with someone like Michael, who has a better understanding of the sport and its dynamics. He has been very supportive and we can relate to each other because of our passion for bodybuilding, said Jola.Jola, 29, an enthusiast from the age of 13, won the title in the under-85kg division. It s taken a lot of work to get where I am now and with the international championships coming up I have put in a lot of extra hours. Jola said Supplement South Africa, a private company that supplied him with his dietary requirements, played a massive role in ensuring he had the relevant nutrition.The pair also praised Andrew King James Thomson, a businessman who sponsored them with branded clothing and other items. Andrew stepped in to support us because he saw how committed we are and invested in us because he believes in our potential, said Jola.Dlodlo said although they often struggled to fundraise for competitions, Thomson had always stepped up, especially when it came to helping them look presentable with the gear he supplied.The two will be leaving to participate in the World Fitness Federation (WFF) international championships in Ireland in the first week of November.Eastern Cape sport, arts and culture spokesman Andile Nduna said the department wished the pair a successful journey. Thembelani and Bulelani s achievements in bodybuilding are commendable and we wish them everything of the best for their upcoming Ireland competition, he said.
