Thirty-six University of Fort Hare students will appear in the East London Magistrate s Court today on charges of public violence. The students were arrested on Tuesday night after they shut down Fleet Street in Quigney.Students are fighting a planned 8% increase in fees, lack of transportation between residences and lecture halls and security issues on campuses.The university was shut down two weeks ago after students boycotted classes demanding that their grievances be addressed by the university s leadership.Yesterday, a group of less than 100 students staged a protest at the university s East London campus.They closed the university s Institutional Advancement office before police put an end to the chaos.During Tuesday night s strike action the students closed off the road outside the campus, starting fires and pelting cars and members of the public walking in the street from the rooftop of the residence on the corner of Station and Fleet streets.The students also used traffic management tools to block the road and set fire to everything they could find to fuel their barricade.The SRC s campus premier claimed the police had provoked the students but an officer on the scene said the police had restored calm.A task team comprising the Council of Churches, parents, student representatives and school management has been established at the Alice campus.SRC president Luxolo Nqala said: The task team will look into all the student grievances. silusaphon @dispatch.co.za
