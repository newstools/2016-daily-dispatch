A new partnership between the Eastern Cape government and Buffalo City Metro is on the cards for the construction of a R1-billion Bhisho Office Precinct. The initiative is aimed at addressing the shortage of government-owned offices in the provincial capital.The BCM council recently gave approval for the city to sign an agreement with the provincial department of roads and public works as the pioneers of the proposed state-of-the-art offices.The metro was roped in by the department to play a crucial role in fast-tracking the implementation of bulk infrastructure and the sale and registration of the identified land.The construction of the new precinct is scheduled to start in May next year.Different provincial government departments which are currently scattered across King William s Town and East London will be accommodated in the 48673m precinct.Provincial spokesman for public works Mphumzi Zuzile told the Daily Dispatch yesterday that BCM had entered into a sale agreement with the department over the land. Transfer of the title deed to Eastern Cape department of roads and public works is under way, Zuzile said, adding that a team was in the process of applying to BCM for the lodgement of town planning documents.In his report to the BCM council, acting city manager Nceba Ncunyana said the estimated costs was as follows:lConstruction: R944-million;lLand: R2.1-million;lBulk service contribution; R30-million; andlProfessional fees: R90-million.Ncunyana said the metro should also approve the signing of another agreement, where it would grant discounts of up to R360-million for rates and development levies for the Bhisho Office Precinct over a period of five years. In turn, BCM would get cash assistance from the Bhisho government to implement three multimillion-rand waste water treatment works projects for the King William s Town area. The projects are worth R835-million. mamelag@dispatch.co.za
