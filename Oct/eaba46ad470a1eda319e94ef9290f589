The status of an investigation by the public protector s office into how KSD municipality spent millions during former President Nelson Mandela s funeral is unclear. Former municipal public accounts committee (Mpac) chairman Pasika Nontshiza wrote to former public protector Thuli Madonsela last week asking for an update.Nontshiza said they were quizzed by deputy public protector Kevin Malunga on May 15 last year but had heard nothing since.Kgalalelo Masibi, a spokeswoman at the public protector s office, had not responded to Daily Dispatch questions yesterday.Madonsela has said she will hand all incomplete cases to her successor, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who reported for duty yesterday.These include the infamous Mandela funeral and Siyenza toilet scandals.Siyenza Group was irregularly awarded a controversial R631-million toilet tender by the Amathole district municipality.In his letter, Nontshiza argued that KSD and OR Tambo residents deserved answers on how money meant for the official mourning period for Mandela had been spent. The Buffalo City investigation was completed and there were consequences the Eastern Cape Development Corporation [investigation] was completed and there were consequences. Are KSD and OR Tambo residents deserving of lesser treatment, he wrote.The Daily Dispatch has previously reported on how millions of rands meant for mourning period programmes were allegedly misused when Mandela died in 2013.In KSD, councillors had to answer to the public protector s office after the cash-strapped council spent more than R19-million of its budget for Mandela s funeral.Some of the items sourced by KSD for the funeral included a gas heater for R22500, wheelie bins, banners and posters, golf shirts for R788652, gumboots for R92500 and trolley bins for more than R1-million among other items.The district council spent hundreds of thousands on catering despite National Treasury strictly instructing municipalities that they should not spend on food leading up to the funeral.A number of high-profile ANC leaders, like suspended Dr WB Rubusana regional secretary Pumlani Mkolo, MP Zukiswa Ncitha and others in BCM landed in hot water for their alleged involvement in the misuse of funds.The cases have not yet been finalised as the matter is still before court.Madonsela was also investigating the Siyenza scandal after DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the EFF laid complaints last year.The Siyenza Group is owned by people with links to high-ranking ANC leaders like secretary-general Gwede Mantashe s wife Nolwandle Mantashe, President Jacob Zuma s son-in-law Lonwabo Sambudla, Mantashe s son Buyambo Mantashe and Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu s son Boitumelo Itholeng. ndamasem@dispatch.co.za
