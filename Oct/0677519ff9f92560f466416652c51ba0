An East London man arrested for masturbating in public will appear in the magistrate s court on charges of public indecency. Because the man is considered a threat to children and women his case was transferred to the family violence and child protection unit, East London police said.Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said a public indecency case had been opened with the Fleet Street police against the 32-year-old man.Mqala said the man was arrested on September 25 in Stephen Street in Quigney. He is currently out on bail.The act was filmed in a cellphone video by two women sitting in a parked car.In the one-minute 33-second video, the man can be seen shielding his lower body with a piece of cardboard with his left hand while masturbating with his right hand.After looking around frantically, he sees the two women filming him and walks while still masturbating to the passenger side of the vehicle.The voices of the two women can be heard as one instructs the other to hit him with the door but the other declines.The one woman then complains the man could soil the window, and suggests the man should be charged. The man continues until he ejaculates.The video has since gone viral on social media. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
