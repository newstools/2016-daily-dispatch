Lawyers for a group of concerned parents who resorted to court in a bid to force Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to resume its academic activities is negotiating with the university s legal team in a bid to settle their differences out of court. Grahamstown attorney Brin Brody, who is acting for the parents, confirmed this morning the two sides were talking to one another. The concerned parents this week launched an urgent application in the Grahamstown High Court in which they seek to force NMMU and its acting vice &#8211; chancellor Sibongile Muthwa to resume academic activities and normal business operations within 48 hours, to use private security companies or police to prevent illegal activity by protesting students, to obtain an interdict against protesting students in the event of illegal activity, and to enforce the student disciplinary code and act against students who infringed it. The university has been closed for about two weeks due to fee protests. NMMU gave notice it would oppose the application and arrived at court this morning with a large team of lawyers ready to argue their case. Brody said the matter would likely continue at 2pm if the two sides could not find agreement.
