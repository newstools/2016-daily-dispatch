Security staff at the University of Fort Hare s Alice campus have started removing students from residences after the Sheriff of the Court served an eviction order on them. According to student representative council president Luxolo Nqala, students were being told to vacate the premises.The university s vice-chancellor Mvuyo Tom said the institution had made reasonable efforts to accommodate students as per the court order. All students who indicated the need for assistance in the duly signed form administered by the dean of students have been assisted. The university is closed and all students were told to go home. Without residences they should be out of campus because they are prone to vandalising property. On Thursday night over 100 students slept on the floor of the university s sports complex hall without bedding.Last month the university shut down amid a violent protest by students over security concerns in the institution. The students suspected an inside job in several incidences of theft of their belongings from residences.The Daily Dispatch last week reported that a disgruntled former Equicent employee, Madoda Sityi, was arrested at his Alice Golf Course home. He was allegedly found with a bunch of locks and a master key to the students rooms.He appeared in court and was released on bail last Friday.Equicent is responsible for security and the construction of a R400-million, 200-bed residence.On Monday the university obtained an eviction order against students and the SRC. The order, served by the Sheriff of the Court on Thursday and again yesterday, gave students five minutes to vacate residences or face being kicked out. silusaphon@dispatch.co.za
