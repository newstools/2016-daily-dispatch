Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has been summoned to appear in court National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams announced on Tuesday. Details of the alleged charge are still emerging this breaking story.Gordhan has been facing claims relating to a possible breach of the Intelligence Act for being involved in the formation of the rogue unit a decade ago at the South African Revenue Service when he was commissioner.There has also been controversy around the R8.5m paid by SARS in restraint of trade settlements to three of its former executives who left during the furore over the so-called rogue unit.The 18-month long restraints of trade were paid to former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay who received R3.9m and to group executive for strategic planning Peter Richter who was paid R3.77m.The two men were implicated in setting up the unit and suspended by SARS commissioner Tom Moyane in December 2014. They resigned in May 2015 after a protracted disciplinary inquiry. The terms of their packages were not disclosed at the time.In addition the annual report of the tax authority tabled in Parliament recently revealed that R858 723 was paid in a six-month restraint of trade settlement to former head of tax and customs enforcement Gene Ravele who also resigned in 2015 ahead of a threatened suspension related to the investigative unit.Another scandal to rock SARS recently has been the suspension of chief officer for business and individual taxes Jonas Makwakwa over suspicious and unusual transactions pending the outcome of a probe into allegations of misconduct. Makwakwa allegedly received unexplained cash deposits and bank transfers amounting to R1.2m between 2010 and 2016.
