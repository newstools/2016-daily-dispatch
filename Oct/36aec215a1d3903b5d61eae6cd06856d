A weekend full of running activity, some of it traditional and some not, nonetheless provided a series of results that will require serious reflection as to just where athletes are in their racing cycles and how circumspect they are being in respect of racing. Certainly winning or running personal best times in two races in two days in October is perhaps a bit over-adventurous, but runners are exactly that, much of the time.The 27km from Fish River to Port Alfred, in its original form attracted many great runners and the new format continues to instill interest.However, the flagship race of the weekend was the MBSA 15km, which attracted a good field albeit that some of the critical elite were missing. The upside of that was a number of surprise results in races throughout the categories.Luthando Hejana is one of those who tests boundaries and he did so again with a win in a fun run on Saturday and again at the 15km on Sunday. The Born 2 Run athlete won the 15km by some distance in registering a 48:08 win.To put that into perspective, it is well off the 45min winning times in the early 1990s of Willie Mtolo and others, but back to back races take it out of the legs.Second place went to a runner who has been suggesting he will break through and emerge on the podium for some time. Malixole Kalideni of the host club, Old Selbornians, finished second in 51:19, while equally exciting unlicensed runner Monwabisi Sigwayi was third in 51:52.Amazingly, the man who came second in the very first MBSA 15km some 25 years ago, Born 2 Run s Makaya Masumpa, now 50-years- old, finished sixth in a sound 55:54. And he was five minutes ahead of his nearest age group rival.Encouragingly the first junior, Chuma Giqo of Real Gijimas was seventh in 56:13, while the first sub veteran from the same club, Andile Stuli, was fifth in 55:48.The first veteran, in ninth place was Xolile Mashicila of Overtakers with a time of 57:05 followed by two members of Born 2 Run, Christophe Bernardie and Desmond Witbooi.In the 50+ (masters) race Masumpa was followed home by Mzoli Mpalala of Real Gijimas and Simon Ngxeke from Born 2 Run.Two other juniors made it into the top 20, which is to be expected over a 10 or 15km race. Sinsipho Jack of Horizon AC and Born 2 Run s Luxolo Shushu finished in just under the hour.The normally keenly contested grandmaster category was much quieter on this occasion but did see as close a finish as can be achieved with Graham Kumm from Oxford Striders and Kenneth Maci of Buffs both being clocked in at 72:40.In the absence of Hanlie Botha in the women s race it would have been expected that the host club would score a win through Andrea Ranger and that is exactly what happened as she came through the finish in 65:05.Born 2 Run s Jaime Griffiths finished second following a back to back race situation with a time of 67:43. Solid as ever was United AC s Chantelle Adoons in third, exactly one minute later, while Mdantsane AC runner Zandile Rubushe was another minute adrift in fourth place.Emma Fourie of Oxford Striders, Natalie Earl and Debbie Gee, both independents, and Babalwa Malgas of Real Gijimas were all prominent in the age groups while Sherae Kreusch, Janine Donaldson, Alison Langtree, all of Born 2 Run, challenged for podium positions.Karima Kitsopoulos of the same club was first in the 60+ women where Old Selbornian team mates and rivals Beanie Beard and Michelle Whittington finished second and third just 17 seconds apart.
