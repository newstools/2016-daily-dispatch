The decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud was nothing but President Jacob Zuma and his faction s tactics of getting rid of Gordhan the Congress of the People said on Monday. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams announced on Tuesday morning that Gordhan former deputy commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) Ivan Pillay and former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashula have been summoned to appear in court on November 2. Zuma and his group want to destroy the economy of this country. We know that Zuma has tried many times to get his hand on the country s treasury Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said.Bloem claimed Zuma removed the well respected minister Nhlanhla Nene and appointed lesser known Des van Rooyen as the minister of finance and that his plans dismally backfired. It is very sad that Gordhan is trying his level best to rescue the economy of this country and we believe that Gordhan must continue with his crusade to rescue the finances of this country.
