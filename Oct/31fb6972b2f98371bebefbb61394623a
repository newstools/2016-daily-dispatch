Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has been served with a summons to stand trial for urging his supporters to invade land. The charges are under the Riotous Assemblies Act with two instances the first dating back to when he was elected EFF president.Malema told the EFF s elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014 that: We are going to occupy the unoccupied land because we need the land. For us to eat we must have the land. For us to work we must have the land&#8230; I come from Seshego. If there is unoccupied land we will go and occupy the land with my branch. You must go and do the same in the branch where you come from. . At the time AfriForum laid criminal charges against Malema.The second case is from June 2016 when Malema told supporters in Newcastle that white people can t claim ownership of land because it belongs to the country s black African majority.
