A group of about 100 students staged a protest at the university of Fort Hare&#8217;s East London campus this morning. The group closed the university&#8217;s Institutional Advancement Office before being stopped dead in their tracks by the police. Public order policing members moved in and quashed the protesters who were singing Masilwe ke uTom akafuni uthetha (Let us fight, Tom doesn&#8217;t want to talk to us) . Mvuyo Tom is the university s Vice-Chancellor. The students were chased away from the main East London campus before they shut down more office. This happened as 36 students from the institution wait to appear in court for public violence after rioting on Fleet Street in the Quigney last night. The students closed of the street, started fires and stoned cars and people from the rooftop near a Fort Hare residence in the street.
