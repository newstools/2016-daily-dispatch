Provincial government spokesman Sizwe Kupelo told the East London Magistrate s Court yesterday he had to increase his life insurance cover, relocate from one East London home to another and change his vehicle registration plates in fear for his life. I took the threats seriously, Kupelo told the court. Kupelo made the startling revelations while being cross-examined in the extortion and intimidation trial of an alleged hitman hired to kill him and Engcobo medical doctor Litha Mboyana.The alleged hit man, Mkhuthazi Excellent Gxaleka, has been in custody since November 2014. He is being represented by East London attorney Ntsikelelo Manyisane.Kupelo on Wednesday testified that Gxaleka had called him in February 2014 alerting him that he had been hired to kill him by people who were jealous of Kupelo s achievements.He had called him again in March saying the alleged hit was imminent and that Kupelo had to consult with a witch doctor if he did not believe the warning.Kupelo opened a case of intimidation at the Cambridge police station although Gxaleka had emphasised that he should not do so.Kupelo testified yesterday he had been terrified of the threats that came in the form of voice calls and text messages.He admitted he had never met or seen Gxaleka until he was arrested. However, the state is convinced Gxaleka was behind the phone calls and SMSes.A former investigating officer on the case, Warrant Officer Hendrick Saunders, who has left the SAPS, took the stand and testified that Gxaleka was arrested while appearing in the Queenstown Magistrate s Court for an unrelated matter.He was linked to Mboyana and Kupelo s cases through cell phone and bank records.Saunders told the court although Gxaleka had used different sim cards to call his victims, he had used the same phone.A Vodacom number used to call Mboyana had also been used to call Kupelo. Gxaleka s bank records also linked him to the crime as Mboyana had paid R15000 into the accused s bank account. The doctor in total had paid the accused R115000.The case was postponed to December 7 for further testimony.
