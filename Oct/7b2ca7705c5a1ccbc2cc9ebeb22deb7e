The African National Congress (ANC) s statement claiming National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete did not reject the state capture report from the Public Protector s office is an attempt by the party to clean up the mess she has created the Democratic Alliance said on Saturday. The fact that the ANC have now through a party statement distanced the Speaker from Parliament s official communication demonstrates its desperation to clean up the mess she has created. The public should not be fooled. That was a statement issued in the name of the Speaker and one finds it hard to believe it was issued without her knowledge and consideration the DA said in a statement on Saturday. Again Baleka Mbete has opted to wear her hat as ANC Chairperson instead of the Speaker of the National Assembly. Her dismissive attitude to what is a report of significant public importance demonstrates Parliament s continued disregard for accountability and lack of interest in supporting institutions which strengthen our democracy. The DA will announce further steps in ensuring this report is made public at a press conference in Johannesburg tomorrow. We will not allow for the ANC to once again frustrate the functioning of the Public Protector s office in a bid to protect Jacob Zuma from answering for his conduct. On Saturday morning the office of the ANC chief whip said Mbete has distanced herself from the grossly inaccurate statement that she had rejected the state capture report.
