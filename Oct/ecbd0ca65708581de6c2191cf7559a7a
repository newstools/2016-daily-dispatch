Government has slapped down one of its own former spin doctors for saying that the South African Broadcasting Corporations (SABC) Hlaudi Motsoeneng was on the right side of the Employment Equity Act with regards to his qualifications. The ministry of communications issued a terse statement on Thursday saying that it distanced itself from the comments made by Mzwanele Jimmy Manyi.Manyi made the comment in a tweet on October 3 that said: Actually Hlaudi is on the RIGHT side of Employment Equity Act for his qualifications. SABC governance issues are BOARD matters NOT Hlaudi. https://twitter.com/KrilaGP/status/783058609060085761The public protector has previously found that Motsoeneng lied about having a matric qualification when he was hired by the SABC a ruling disputed by Motsoeneng. Furthermore said the statement the ministry wishes to state that Mr Manyi is no longer an advisor to the Minister of Communications and therefore does not speak on behalf of the Ministry. The ministry said it played no role in the appointment of managers at the state broadcaster. These appointments follow the normal recruitment processes as prescribed within the policy of the public broadcaster. Manyi has been vocal in his support of the Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma and now runs an organisation called the Decolonisation Foundation.Reacting to the statement from the ministry Manyi insisted on Twitter that he was on firm ground and cited a section of the Employment Equity Act that explains how a person could be suitably qualified for a job as a result of one or a combination of factors.These included a person s formal qualifications prior learning relevant experience or capacity to acquire within a reasonable time the ability to do the job.
