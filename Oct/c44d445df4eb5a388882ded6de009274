More than 300 of the country s men and women in blue descended on East London this week to put their strength and stamina to the test in the annual national functional fitness championships. The championships, in its 17th year, is taking place at the Hamiltons Sport Club. It is the second time the city is hosting the event.National chairman Urbanus De Witt, known as Whytie, said the championships consisted of about 350 policemen and women from each province and an additional team from the Pretoria-based head office.The challenge consists of a 21-piece obstacle course, where they have to jump above a 2m wall, crawl under a narrow net and carry heavy objects while running.The Eastern Cape police broke the record when Siphamandla Thunzi, a visible policing officer from Flagstaff, paced across the course in three minutes and nine seconds.Thunzi scooped the gold medal in the 30 to 34 years age group and 70-79kg.KZN team member Paula Labuschagne, from the VIP Unit, said she had been taking part in the championships for the past 13 years. This year I received bronze in the 45-49 age group and 54-64kg category, so next year I must push for gold, she said.
