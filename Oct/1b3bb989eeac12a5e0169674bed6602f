The Panayiotou murder trial will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Wednesday morning with the state expected to call its first witness. The trial was postponed at around lunchtime on Tuesday after state advocate Marius Stander called for an adjournment.The court heard on Tuesday how gun residue on her hand indicated that Jayde Panayiotou 29 had tried to defend herself from her killers shielding her face from a fatal shot to the head after she had already been shot twice in the back.Jayde s husband Christopher Panayiotou 30 is accused of hiring alleged hitmen Sinethemba Nemembe 28 and Zolani Sibeko 35 to murder her.The three have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping robbery and murder.The alleged triggerman Sizwesakhe Vumazonke 36 died last month after slipping into a coma. The cause of death has not yet been determined.The court heard how Vumazonke immediately after the murder was allegedly still holding on to Jayde s book bag and laptop when he visited a sangoma for a cleansing . It was this visit that set police on his trail.Meanwhile in a lengthy plea explanation read out by defence advocate Terry Price SC Panayiotou said he planned to show how police had unlawful and unconstitutional tactics to try to build a case against him.The state claims Panayiotou paid Luthando Siyoni 31 an employee at his Infinity Cocktail Bar in Algoa Park to recruit hitmen to kidnap and kill Jayde on April 21 last year.Siyoni has admitted his involvement and implicated Panayiotou. I will request the court to order a trial-within-a-trial on the basis that the evidence obtained following the removal of Siyoni from Infinity at approximately 8.15pm on April 27 2015 is inadmissible Price read. All the evidence thereafter is tainted as a result of the police assaulting intimidating and unlawfully pressuring Siyoni to implicate me. The trial continues.
