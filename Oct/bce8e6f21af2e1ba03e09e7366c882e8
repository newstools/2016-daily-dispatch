South Africa s free-to-air television stations want to screen news bulletins when fewer people are watching. The SABC following a similar request by eTV wants its licensing conditions to be amended so that it no longer has to air news broadcasts during prime or peak viewing times.Democratic Alliance (DA) spokesman Phumzile van Damme said on Monday that this would have the effect of dumbing down South Africans. According to a presentation by the SABC at a public hearing last week at the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) on a similar request by eTV the public broadcaster requested that all free-to-air broadcasters be allowed flexibility to decide whether to air news broadcasts during prime time said Van Damme. This means that should it be approved by Icasa free-to-air TV stations in South Africa will no longer be obliged to air news broadcasts during prime time. She said the DA would object to this when Icasa appeared before the Portfolio Committee on Communications on Tuesday. We will also request that Icasa which has the constitutional obligation to regulate broadcasting in the public interest spell out its position on the canning of prime-time news she said.Free-to-air broadcasters have an obligation under the Electronic Communications Act to facilitate news and educational programming in the national interest. It is logical that this must happen during prime time when most South Africans are watching TV .More than 12-million people watch television during prime time according to the SABC with 79% of adults in urban areas relying on free-to-air television as the most regular source of news. Only one in 10 rely on social media as a news source. Icasa must place a further obligation on the SABC in particular to ensure that the news it provides the South African public is impartial balanced and an accurate depiction of conditions in South Africa said Van Damme.
