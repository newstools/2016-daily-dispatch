The Musicians Association of South Africa (Masa) has confirmed that it will be footing the bill for the outstanding money owed to artists who performed at the failed Thank You SABC Music Concert held in September. It was revealed last week that the public broadcaster had contributed R2.6-million towards the concert despite previously denying any monetary involvement to TshisaLIVE.Despite the balloon payment from the SABC organisers told Sowetan that they had still not paid artists because of a shortfall .Prior to the show organisers told TshisaLIVE that The Department of Arts and Culture will help us but the department refuted the claims saying it had received a proposal but had opted not to make a contribution.Now Masa has said that it would come to the rescue but on certain conditions. We have asked for a list of performers those who were paid deposits and those who did not get it the organisation s Oupa Lebogo told Sowetan.Controversy around the concert began after the SABC initially sent out a statement saying that it would be footing the bill for the show. But SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago soon made contact with TshisaLIVE saying that the statement wasn t sent out on its behalf.The show dominated the trends list on social media as pictures of an empty stadium streamed in. It was later revealed that controversial music promoter Morris Roda earlier investigated by the authorities after a failed Miriam Makeba tribute concert which cost taxpayers millions was one of the main organisers of the show.Masa has refused to elaborate on where it would be getting the cash from to pay artists and the SABC has remained mum on whether it will contribute further.
