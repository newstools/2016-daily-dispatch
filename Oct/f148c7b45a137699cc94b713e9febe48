Independent Media s decision to leave the Press Council and set up its own tribunal and appoint a staff member as its ombud has been harshly criticised by the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef). &#8220;We believe that self-regulation should be executed at arm s length by an independent regulatory mechanism like the Press Council and not by employees of media companies &#8221; Sanef said in a statement on Friday.&#8220;To use an internal ombudsman as a replacement of independent arbiters is unacceptable.&#8221;Sanef called on Independent media to rescind its decision.Independent Media s decision affects all titles in the group including The Star The Sunday Independent The Cape Argus Pretoria News and Isolezwe.The decision affects the jurisdiction of the press ombudsman to adjudicate complaints levelled against media houses that contravene the Press Code.The Press Council and Press Code is the result of years of research consultation and negotiations between the country s media houses and roleplayers including civil society political organisations and academia including through the Press Freedom Commission headed by Chief Justice Pius Langa.Sanef said Independent Media and its management had participated in these discussions and decisions but now blamed &#8220;loopholes&#8221; in the Press Code for its decision to cut all ties with the Press Council.Independent Media s decision results in all its publications both print and digital &#8220;will fall outside the exemptions of pre-publication approvals by the Film and Publications Board enjoyed by members of the Press Council&#8221;.Sanef said it was committed to the current system of independent co-regulation by the Press Council which has four retired judges in its various structures and a panel that includes more representatives from the public than from the media.&#8220;We take very seriously the findings of the Press Ombudsman or appeals panel about mistakes made by journalists in the exercise of their duties &#8221; said Sanef.&nbsp;&nbsp;
