SAMWU strikers are apparently back at work this morning at Amatola Water&#8217;s 11 bulk water supply and treatment works, but for one day only. Their demand to be addressed by Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula M o konyane has been partially met. She flies into East London for a meeting with workers and her board tomorrow. Samwu&#8217;s ADM regional chairman Victor Totolo said the return today would be temporary and would depend on the outcome of the Minister&#8217;s intervention. Samwu wants the Amatola Board chairwoman Nonkulunga Mnqetha out because she caused divisions in Samwu as well as her involvement in a fraud case, said Totolo. The board&#8217;s CEO Lefadi Makibinyane said he had been told by Totolo this morning that workers would return to their posts and start getting water supply going again. He was checking with his remaining staff to see what was happening out at the plants.
