More than 150 homeless residents of Lusikisiki are threatening to take Ingquza Hill local municipality bosses to court for failing to provide them with temporary houses. The Grahamstown High Court last week granted a court order forcing the local authority to construct emergency temporary habitable tents or similar dwellings or shelters and amenities at New Rest village for the homeless residents within 72 hours of the granting of the order.The municipality had also agreed it would not harass or threaten those residents.&nbsp;The order came after a group of residents from New Rest village, situated less than 5km from the town, had their houses flattened by municipal bulldozers earlier this month.The Daily Dispatch has previously reported that about 40 homes were demolished on October 6, leaving about 150 people homeless.Speaking to the Saturday Dispatch yesterday, one of the affected residents, Gcinithemba Ndila, confirmed they were taking the municipality back to court for failing to honour the court order. On Thursday next week, we are going back to court, he said. They were supposed to give us temporary houses two weeks ago but all they did was come here on Thursday and try to force us to sign some forms. Those forms asked us about how much we earn and other personal details that had nothing to do with the court order. They [municipality] were told to provide us with temporary shelters but in those forms they say they will build those structures on land that they will identify. Several attempts to contact municipal authorities were unsuccessful at the time of writing yesterday. No response was received from municipal spokesman Zamuxolo Matwasa on the matter. sikhon@dispatch.co.za&nbsp;
