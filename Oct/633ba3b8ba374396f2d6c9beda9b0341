Bulelwa Ndudula, the widow of murdered senior Bhisho official Sakhekile Ndudula, may have to fight for her career if the provincial education department decides to fill her teacher s post. In her bail application in the East London Magistrate s Court last week, Ndudula pleaded to be released as she feared losing her R12 000-a-month job as a result of absenteeism. However, the court denied her plea, condemning her to prison until the trial is finalised.The education department said this week that Ndudula, the maths and choir teacher at R H Godlo Primary School in Mdantsane s NU5, will be temporarily replaced in an effort to keep the fourth term running smoothly.Reade more in the Daily Dispatch&nbsp;
