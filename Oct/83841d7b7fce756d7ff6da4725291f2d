Two Beaconhurst High lawyers-to-be donned their legal robes , squared up to the opposition and came second in the National Moot Court competition at the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg last weekend. Grade 11 pupils Thando Mtombeni and Catelyn Cumberlege, both 17, were up against 36 schools in the competition which is a simulated court where participants present written and oral arguments.The topic in this year s competition, which was organised by the department of education, centred on a racist incident between a pupil and a teacher and required competitors to be familiar with the constitution and the South African Schools Act. They were very persuasive and argued so well, said teacher Ryno Simms, who accompanied the pupils.Simms said that while some rounds were held at the University of Pretoria, the finals took place in the Constitutional Court where Cumberlege and Mtombeni took their place at the bench before a panel of eight judges, three of them Constitutional Court judges.Provincial coordinator of moot court in the provincial department of education, Funeka Jwaai, said they were very proud of the girls and that she and the director of school enrichment, Londoloza Lutya, would congratulate them at their school on Thursday. Being in the Constitutional Court was amazing but nerve-wracking, Mtombeni said.Cumberlege said the judges had given them good feedback. They said we spoke very well. I learnt so much and feel one step closer to where I want to be as a [future] lawyer. barbarah@dispatch.co.za
