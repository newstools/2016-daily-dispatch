Despite court challenges by two of its members the African National Congress (ANC) said yesterday it anticipates and looks forward to the imminent release of the state capture report pending the decisions of the courts in this regard . The public protector s final report spokesman Zizi Kodwa said will assist the ANC and South Africa to gain clarity on the allegations and point to the resolution of the reported challenges .This came after Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen approached the High Court in Pretoria to interdict public protector Thuli Madonsela from issuing the report.The case is likely to be stood down and joined with President Jacob Zuma s application to interdict the release of the report next Tuesday after four opposition parties opposed Van Rooyen s application.Kodwa noted that the public protector s final report into the matter with its binding recommendations are at all times subject to judicial review .But said Kodwa: Allegations of undue influence in the appointment of Cabinet ministers among others are an attack on the character of the revolutionary movement an attack on our democratic state and an assault on the confidence our people place on our movement and government. Kodwa also thanked Madonsela, on her last day in the job, for her committed service to South Africa . TMG Digital
