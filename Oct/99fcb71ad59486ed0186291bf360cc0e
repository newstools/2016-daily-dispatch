A prominent criminal lawyer has weighed-in on ridiculous efforts being made by the state to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema. Attorney William Booth questioned the soundness of the charges brought against the two men and said: Justifiably people are saying this is a political ploy. He told CapeTalk (www.capetalk.co.za) radio on Thursday evening that the apartheid-era legislation being used to prosecute Malema could even be regarded as unconstitutional. If one looks at what had happened to Pravin Gordhan. A ridiculous summons has been issued against him and others. The whole issue is that you have the national director (of public prosecutions) saying publically that he wasn t even party to Gordhan being prosecuted. Surely he must have overseen it said Booth.He said the manner in which the country s prosecuting authorities and police were operating puts a question mark over the whole criminal justice system . And I think it s a very sad day when prosecuting authorities feel that it is in the public interest to prosecute in these particular instances. The Priority Crimes Litigation Unit within the National Prosecuting Authority should he added be focussing on serious crime in South Africa. They should be focussing on serious crime. South Africa is rife with crime serious corruption serious problems violent crimes serious fraud and theft. Yet they decide to spend time energy in prosecuting these particular instances he said.
