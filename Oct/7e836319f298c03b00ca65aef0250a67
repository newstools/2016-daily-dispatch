Corruption, state capture, factionalism within the ANC- led tripartite alliance and the SACP s call for South Africa to ditch capitalism for socialism will be some of the issues tackled in East London this weekend. SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila is expected to address the party s Eastern Cape provincial council at Gompo Hall in Duncan Village today and tomorrow.Mapaila, a vocal critic of the Guptas and staunch supporter of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, is expected to come out guns blazing when he takes to the podium to talk about corruption, factionalism, socialism and state capture.With the SACP believing that some of its national leaders, including general secretary Blade Nzimande, have been personally targeted as the war of words between the communists and some ANC leaders wages on, Mapaila is likely to go for the jugular and lay into detractors of the SACP.The influential SACP official broke ranks earlier this year, when he was among the first leaders to call on the ANC to recall President Jacob Zuma after allegations surfaced of the Guptas having undue influence on him and on how cabinet ministers were chosen.Mapaila has also spoken up against the so-called premier league a grouping of Free State, Mpumalanga and North West premiers said to be campaigning for positions at the ANC s national elective conference in December next year. Speaking about the weekend gathering, SACP provincial spokesman Siyabonga Mdodi described it as an important platform where the party would reflect on many issues. This is important for our party, given the challenges facing the South Africa revolution and the inability of the ANC-led movement to rise to the occasion because of the triple negative tendencies of rent seeking, corruption and blatant factionalism. The provincial council is a platform to prepare our party for any eventuality given the class battles under way in our country and those ahead as factionalists get more desperate and vicious, he said this week.Mdodi said yesterday that the provincial council would essentially be used to reflect on the party s 10 years from 2007 to next year.The 600 party members expected to attend would also discuss what the SACP should roll out from next year until 2027 as it pursued socialism. We will look at our strengths and weaknesses over the last 10 years. We will basically be dealing with the life of the party, Mdodi said.The SACP, which promotes itself as the vanguard of the working class and the poor, has in recent years been criticised for having some of its leaders, like Higher Education Minister Nzimande and Public Works Deputy Minister Jeremy Cronin, serve in cabinet.This was a national congress resolution and Mdodi said they would also reflect on what had been achieved by party members in government.
