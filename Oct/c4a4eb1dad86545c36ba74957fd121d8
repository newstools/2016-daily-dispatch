Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has again denied that she left behind an unpaid repair bill when she left office. This follows reports suggesting that Madonsela whose last day in the job office was Friday did not pay R750 000 in repairs when her son Wantu crashed her state-owned BMW X6 in 2012.The New Age newspaper recently said the cost of repairing the car was R470 000 and this had since accumulated interest and stood at more than R750 000 . Reports at the time of the crash however put the damage at R100 000. Madonsela said she was cleared of any wrong-doing by the auditor-general. That is an issue that if Parliament had not postponed my appearance last week you would recall that I was supposed to present a report last week on Thursday and suddenly that was cancelled without an explanation I would have been able to explain that that matter was dealt with by the auditor-general and G-Fleet. Both of them came to the conclusion that I was not involved in the matter that I was sleeping I didn t give instructions for the car to be used Madonsela told Radio 702.Wantu was behind the wheel when the car hit a garden wall on Lucky Bean Crescent near Moreleta Park in Pretoria. Wantu claimed that he swerved while trying to avoid a dog on the road.Public protector spokesperson Oupa Segalwe previously reportedly said that Madonsela made a donation towards the costs of the repairs to the car. The auditor-general found there was no wrongdoing on the part of the public protector as she hadn t given permission for the use of the car and was asleep at the time of the incident. But she still donated around R30 000 towards the fixing of the car. She also paid from her own purse for the wall that was damaged in the process Segalwe said. TMG Digital
