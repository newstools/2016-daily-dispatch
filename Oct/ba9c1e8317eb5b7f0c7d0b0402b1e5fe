Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation have written to the National Prosecuting Authority threatening to go to court if their charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan are not withdrawn. In an urgent letter to National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams the two organisations argue that the conduct of the NPA is baseless and could have serious consequences for the country. This is a matter of paramount public interest and our clients intend to review and set aside your decision to institute the charges against the minister of finance under the constitutional principle of legality and otherwise unless you withdraw the decision or furnish a cogent basis for the actions taken the two organisations told Abrahams in the letter.The rand plunged and bonds slumped after Gordhan was summoned to appear in court.He was charged with fraud against the backdrop of a battle that has pitted him against state-owned companies accused of mismanagement and corruption.Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation have given Abrahams until 4pm on October 21 to drop the charges against Gordhan or face a legal challenge.A prominent criminal lawyer has also weighed in on ridiculous efforts being made by the state to prosecute Gordhan and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema.Attorney William Booth questioned the soundness of the charges brought against the two men and said: Justifiably people are saying this is a political ploy. He told CapeTalk radio on Thursday evening that the apartheid-era legislation being used to prosecute Malema could even be regarded as unconstitutional.Booth said the manner in which the country s prosecuting authorities and police were operating puts a question mark over the whole criminal justice system . And I think it s a very sad day when prosecuting authorities feel that it is in the public interest to prosecute in these particular instances. The Priority Crimes Litigation Unit within the National Prosecuting Authority should he added be focusing on dealing with the serious crime in the country Yet they spend time energy in prosecuting these particular instances.
