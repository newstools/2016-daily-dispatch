The Congress of the People (Cope) has planned a picket outside the Office of the Public Protector for Friday. It s not to protest said the party s Dennis Bloem but rather to publicly show our appreciation for how Thuli Madonsela served this country with distinction .Friday will be the last day in the job for the popular Madonsela Bloem said and for seven years Madonsela had to endure very difficult and painful insults by those who were hell-bent to loot the country s very scarce resources .She was labelled as an enemy agent counter-revolutionary and a CIA spy and her life was constantly in danger just because of her commitment to fight and root out the cancer of corruption he added.Bloem lent her the nickname of the late former prime minister of the UK Margaret Thatcher when he said of Madonsela: We salute the Iron Lady and (she) will forever be remembered.
