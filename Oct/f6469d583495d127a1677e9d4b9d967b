&nbsp;Buffalo City Metro bosses and community leaders held marathon meetings to try and ease tensions that arose between shack dwellers of a newly established squatter camp in Vergenoeg and residents of the township. The township residents were up in arms on Thursday after more than 100 shacks mushroomed close to the township.The residents argued that the squatter camp would decrease the market value of properties in the suburb and would lead to illegal electricity connections, widely known as Izinyoka.A meeting was held on Thursday at 6pm, where a task team was elected after six shacks were destroyed by BCM, amid tensions.At a meeting held earlier in the day between the two clashing communities, Ward 10 councillor Roseline Vitbooi and BCM officials sought to come up with a solution.Another meeting facilitated by BCM council speaker Alfred Mtsi was scheduled to take place yesterday afternoon.Yesterday, Vitbooi told the Dispatch that another meeting would be held on Monday to finalise the fate of the shack dwellers.A further 100 shacks were set to be destroyed yesterday but the demolition team was told to wait for the outcome of Monday s meeting.Dozens of families were picking up pieces of their demolished shacks yesterday.Marvin Christopher, 53, said he had lost more than R3000 worth of building material. I pleaded in vain for them to please wait for the councillor to be here before they do anything. Steven Nell, 38, said he had applied for a loan to buy his building material, which he was repaying. I was not even home when the demolition happened, I had attended a meeting at my child s school, when I came back my house was flat, I ve lost a lot. I won t be able to recover the money and I won t be able to restore the belongings lost, he said.Michael Moeere, 46, said he was upset his shack had been destroyed with his furniture still inside.The shack dwellers are approved beneficiaries of a housing development currently underway at Fynbos 2, which started in 2014 and is due for completion in 2017.According to BCM spokesman Sibusiso Cindi, the residents were moved from their Fynbos houses to allow a construction company to move on site to build the houses.So far, 100 of the 470 low-cost houses have been completed.Vitbooi said 100 temporary shelters were made available for the people awaiting the completion of their low-cost houses. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
