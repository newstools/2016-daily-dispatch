The Democratic Alliance Youth is to lay criminal charges against Collen Maine the president of the ANC Youth League after he called on MK veterans to take up arms for President Jacob Zuma. Maine made the call at a pro-Zuma march organised by the ANC s eThekweni region on Saturday.Congress of the People also announced earlier that it was laying charges against Maine for incitement to violence. Maine reportedly called on Comrades from Umkhonto we Sizwe bring your guns. Now is the time to defend the revolution. He added: We must do it. Generations that came before did it. They sacrificed their lives. Maine also reportedly tore into Zuma s detractors calling them snakes who surround the president trying to bring him down .DA Students Organisation (DASO) leader Yusuf Cassim described Maine s statements as dangerous callous and irresponsible saying they were in direct contravention with the Constitution which in Chapter 2 section 16 states that: Everyone has the right to freedom of expression which does not extend to (a) propaganda for war; (b) incitement of imminent violence; or (c) advocacy of hatred that is based on race ethnicity gender or religion and that constitutes incitement to cause harm. Cassim said the statements were an insult to SA s Constitutional Democracy and deserved the strongest possible condemnation. Many South Africans fought and died for a democratic South Africa at peace with itself and the world. To call for civil war goes against everything the struggle for democracy represented. It is telling that at a time of profound crisis for young South Africans with Universities shut-down and youth unemployment rapidly rising the ANCYL is more concerned with protecting Jacob Zuma than the plight of our youth Cassim stated. We trust that the SAPS will investigate this matter fully and that the NPA will find the courage to act without fear or favour in pursuing this case as well he added.
