The first day of exams started for most matrics yesterday as thousands across the country sat for their English paper. Though the exam went off without a hitch, a group of about 200 pupils marched on De Vos Malan High School in King William s Town to raise some grievances.The school is used as a central examination venue.The pupils, calling themselves the Progressive Forces of Learners in the King William s Town and Fort Beaufort districts, listed immediate provision of teachers, new infrastructure for Vukile Tshwete Senior Secondary School and free distribution of sanitary pads every month.The group organised the march on realising the education department will not meet the objectives outlined in the minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure which stipulates that by November 29 2016 all schools made of mud, asbestos, steel and wood should be eradicated and by the same date should have adequate electricity, water and sanitation .Provincial spokesman Loyiso Pulumane said various rural and township schools from the region were represented. They converged at De Vos Malan, central examination station, with a petition which listed their grievances, which education MEC Mandla Makapula was quick to attend to and address. Makupula assured them that their concerns had been recognised, most of which were already being attended to before he signed the petition.Pulumane confirmed that none of the pupils involved in the march were in matric. We have had a smooth start to the English language exam throughout the province, without any complications, and although the march held by the learners raised alarm when it almost got out of hand, it did not affect the examinations or the matrics writing exams, he said.Hudson Park High School principal Roy Hewett said the paper arrived in good time for his 215 matrics, and the season had kicked off to a good start. Everything was on schedule and we had positive feedback from our learners, which put us at ease and we are confident. Mzomhle High School school principal Malusi Koltana said the township school was ready for the exams and everything had started off very well. It was all smiles when they walked out the school today, which was very pleasing, and many of them did say they had enjoyed the paper, he said.The chief invigilator at Stirling High School, Cindy Meade, said there were no hiccups at her school.
