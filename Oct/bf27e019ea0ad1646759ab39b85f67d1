Rhodes University is very tense this morning as a small group of students try to enforce a national campus shutdown over student fees. There is a strong presence of public order police on campus and they are shadowing the group. Some lectures have been disrupted and university property vandalised. Some students have covered there faces. Concerned staff, students and even local clergy with white sashes that have peace written on them are following the group to try and prevent any confrontation with police.
