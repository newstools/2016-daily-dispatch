The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board chairperson s defiance will actually reveal the full scope of its malfeasance to the public the Democratic Alliance said. The party s James Selfe said Maguvhe had on Thursday made it clear that he would not do the honourable thing by acceding to the portfolio committee on communication s request that the board resign with immediate effect . Maguvhe showed no remorse for the mess at the SABC instead questioning the decisions made by the committee. Maguvhe was obstinate in his insistence that he is going nowhere Selfe said.The board had been summoned by the parliamentary committee on Wednesday to give an account of the controversial appointment of the former chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive for corporate affairs.The committee resolved to demand that the board members resign and for the board to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry.Maguvhe had told media on Thursday that the committee is bullying me to resign and threw down a gauntlet: Let the inquiry come. I am ready for it. So it means I am going nowhere. Selfe said of the chairperson s challenge: If Maguvhe is intent on taking the low road then Parliament will have no option but to proceed with the decision to institute a formal parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the Board and reveal the full scope of its malfeasance to the public. He urged Parliament to stick to its guns and institute this inquiry forthwith because for too long the board and Hlaudi Motsoeneng have acted shambolically and without due regard for the Constitution and the principles espoused therein .
