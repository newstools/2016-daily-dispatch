The SABC has once again batted away questions regarding the footing of the bill for a music concert that was held last month. The public broadcaster has repeatedly denied that it had made monetary contributions to the poorly attended Thank You SABC Music Concert held at Orlando Stadium in September. However it has since been revealed that the public broadcaster did in fact plough R2.6 million into the event. There was no space or time where I read a statement that you just said&#8230;. I can tell you what I said. I said we are not the organisers of the event therefore that statement is not what I said said SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago.Communications Minister Faith Muthambi this week confirmed that the SABC had made a contribution of R2 695 750 to the Phumelela Group the organisers of the event.She was replying to a question posed to her by the Democratic Alliance.The SABC initially sent out a press release saying that it was footing the bill for the show. It then did an about-turn saying that the media release that was sent out was incorrect.
