Coming second on a national scale with my fairly new business is a great achievement and I can t wait to share it with the rest of my team, because it has been a joint effort all the way. This recognition clearly means we are doing something right. Mdantsane-born Velile Ndlumbini of Imonti Tours, who was nominated as a provincial finalist in 2014, scooped the title last month and was among the finalists at the national awards. Having been a finalist has been an honour for me because I was among big companies like Thompson Tours, and other companies I often get to work with. For a small-medium enterprise like us, it has been an honour and I am now more inspired to up my game. Last month we joined the South African Tourism Association which most SMMEs struggle to join because of the hefty fee, but it is a stepping stone to a successful business, said Ndlumbini.In the three-star division, Tube n Axe Backpackers Lodge just outside Tsitsikamma took the title, which is a strong comeback from 2009-10 when the lodge won the adventure province award in the category for best backpacker hostel.Bloukrans Bungy Face Adrenalin in Tsitsikamma, which has the highest bungy jump off Africa s highest bridge at 216m high, scooped top prize for action and adventure.New SA Tourism CEO Sisa Ntshona said the construction of the new N2 behind the Wild Coast and new Mthatha-Johannesburg air link would be central to attracting tourists to a province that has seen an incredible increase and dedication from service providers.
