Traditional leaders in the Eastern Cape have resolved that Contralesa should remain apolitical, as dictated by its constitution. During a heated provincial general council meeting in Mthatha on Monday, Eastern Cape members argued that robust efforts should rather be undertaken to unite and strengthen the organisation.However, it was also suggested that wide consultation with rural communities should be held before a political movement separate from Contralesa could be formed.Contralesa s NEC had recommended that the organisation break ties with the ANC and form a new political party, but political analysts warned the cash-strapped Contralesa it would battle to fund the move.Contralesa provincial treasurer Chief Mnoneleli Ranuga said they did not even have money to buy lunch for PEC meetings.A final resolution will be made by 126 delegates from the nine provinces at a national general council in Johannesburg at the weekend.Contralesa provincial chairman Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana said the organisation and ANC in the province had cordial relations, but it was in the national structures that things were bad.AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Sigcawu fully supported the formation of a new political party, but warned it would only be realistic if traditional leaders had support from their own families first.Political analyst Dr Somadoda Fikeni said forming a political party was not a practical idea for traditional leaders. It may jolt the ANC into engaging them in the feeling that they are neglected. Fikeni said the country could instead see traditional leaders expressing support for other political parties.Eastern Cape ANC secretary Oscar Mabuyane said the party and Contralesa in the province still got on, but warned that if traditional leaders stopped supporting the party it would find itself squeezed into a corner contesting the opposition and its own people like traditional leaders in elections. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
