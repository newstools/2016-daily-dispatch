Rhodes University #FeesMustFall protesters and support staff are meeting on campus this morning to discuss Sasco calls for a shutdown of universities. Pleas by student leaders to join the protesters appears to have struck a chord with workers, many of whom have children studying at the university. Some staff belonging to the National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), however, told DispatchLIVE that although they supported the students plight, they feared not being paid if they did not work. Nehawu leaders at the university asked students if they wanted a shutdown, to which they replied yes . A student leader said the university must shut down for five days in solidarity with Sasco s call. The mood is fairly tense and a small group of police is watching from a distance. One academic said it would be a &#8220;game changer&#8221; if nehawu joined.
