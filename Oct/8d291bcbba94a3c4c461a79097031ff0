An early morning fishing trip turned into a tragedy when a 30-year-old man apparently fell from Morgan Bay s dolerite crags and was found dead in the ocean on Saturday morning. National Sea Rescue Services (NSRI) East London commander Geoff McGregor said his station, the Eastern Cape emergency services (EMS) rescue helicopter and police had been called when the angler s gear and personal effects were found near the cliffs. A fixed-wing aircraft flying in the area at the time joined in the search when a body was located off-shore of Morgan Bay by crew aboard the fixed wing aircraft. An NSRI rescue swimmer, also an EMS rescue paramedic, was deployed into the surf from the helicopter and the body of a 30-year-old East London man was recovered to the beach by the rescue swimmer and was confirmed to be deceased, he said.Morgan Bay Hotel owner Richard Warren-Smith said it was believed that the man went fishing on the Morgan Bay cliff at 1am on Saturday. When he did not return at about sunrise, people started getting worried. A guy by the name of Dirk was the first one who started looking for the man s body. Then he asked me for a jet-ski. I sent my son with a jet-ski to go help. They spent about half an hour looking near the cliffs but they did not find anything. When they couldn t find the body, I then informed the NSRI. He said the NSRI spent 90 minutes looking and finally located the body not far from the cliffs.Warren-Smith said he suspected that the man might have missed a step and fallen off. I ve seen big waves and there were no big waves that day. He was probably unconscious when he fell into the sea, said Warren-Smith.Police have opened an inquest docket and the body of the man, who is not being named until his family have been informed, has been handed over to forensic pathology services.
