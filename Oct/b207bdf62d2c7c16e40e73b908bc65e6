Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle, Health MEC Phumza Dyantyi and Education MEC Mandla Makupula visited casualty wards at Bhisho Hospital after hundreds of pupils were rushed into hospital following an outbreak of diarrhoea. The pupils are all from schools in the King William&#8217;s Town area. They fell sick and started vomiting and complaining of stomach cramps after eating umphokoqo/umvubo (pap with sour milk). Dyantyi said over 1 000 pupils from 10 schools have received treatment from two provincial hospitals (Bhisho and Grey). Masualle has called for food to be subjected to stringent health inspection before it is consumed by pupils. Dozens of Grade 12 pupils are also among the learners rushed to the two hospitals. Speaking from a hospital bed Agcobile Sonjica from Jali Secondary School said she was worried she might miss out on writing the Maths literacy paper tomorrow morning. Makupula said special arrangements would be made for the learners to rewrite the papers.
