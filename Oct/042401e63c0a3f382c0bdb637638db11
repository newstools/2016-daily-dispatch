By BONGANI FUZILE and SIYA BOYAPolice are searching for a dangerous fugitive who escaped from police custody by pretending to be an attorney. Mlondolozi Mpayipheli walked calmly out of the holding cells at the East London Magistrate s Court last Monday, dressed in a smart suit.A source in the magistrate s complex said: Someone pretended to be a police officer with a fake letter and a fake signature of a retired magistrate and gave this to prison officials, who then released him to attend a false trial at the East London court. The daring escape happened before Mpayipheli was about to appear in court for one of his criminal cases. He pretended to be a lawyer representing an arrested suspect and simply went through a gate without being noticed.East London police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said yesterday police were still searching for Mpayipheli.A police source at the East London Magistrate s Court told the Dispatch that Mpayipheli arrived from East London Prison on Monday, but when it was time to enter the court he was nowhere to be seen. There was a requisition form for him to come to court from prison. He has cases in Butterworth and Cape Town. He is [allegedly] involved in many robbery cases. Apparently this is the third time he had been taken to court from prison but failed to appear. A retired magistrate s signature was forged in the requisition form for him to come to the court, said the source.A source at East London Prison said: The inmate was incarcerated in Medium B [section]. He escaped from Butterworth correctional centre in 2013 and was transferred to Medium B. Mqala said no case had been opened against anyone in connection with Mpayipheli s escape.Eastern Cape Correctional Services spokesman Zama Feni said Medium B inmates were mostly awaiting trial prisoners and transfers to court were taken care of by police. bonganif@dispatch.co.za/ siyab@dispatch.co.za
