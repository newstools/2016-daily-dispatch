About 30 dis a bled pupils from Ikhwezi Lokusa Special School this morning embarked on a protest that saw them march in wheelchairs to the department of education. Among their grievances is that they wash with cold water, co r poral punishment is being applied and some even claim that they are smacked with open hand s and other general issues with what they call an abusive code of conduct. They also complained that their cellphones are being withheld. They delayed traffic leading from Ikhwezi township near Mthath a and also blockaded the entrance at the Botha Sigcau Building which houses about 11 government departments. The pupils who were demanding an audience with someone from the department were chanting freedom songs and stomping with others shouting Amalungelo ethu (Our rights) .
