All eyes were on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday when he delivered his mid-term budget speech in Parliament. The speech said as much about SA s politics as it did about the state of the public purse.An hour and 14 minutes into Gordhan s speech, Parliament s cameras caught President Jacob Zuma sleeping. Everything continued as normal. Gordhan is due in court next week to face charges by the Hawks that have been described as politically motivated.
