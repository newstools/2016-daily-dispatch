When Sam Gouws was retrenched from her job as a human resources manager in August she decided to use her time to bring Christmas cheer to East London s senior citizens. What started off as a mini campaign to urge family and friends to pledge Father Christmas shoeboxes to residents of two old-age homes, has taken off and Gouws, 36, has since collected enough pledges for a third home with more to come. I have given Santa shoeboxes to children for a few years, so decided I would use my time to bless senior citizens, said Gouws.She initially identified Silver Crown and Langham House old-age homes, but soon reached her target of 101 pledges and so 84 residents of DJ Sobey old-age home were added. A friend suggested I take the campaign to Facebook and I have been overwhelmed by the response. This week I received more than 84 pledges so I will be adding another home to the list. Gouws consulted with the matrons of the homes to come up with a list of suggestions that can be added to decorated recycled shoeboxes.These include toiletries like soap, baby powder and Vaseline, books, snakes and ladders, playing cards or wool and crochet hooks for crafty residents.Treats like marshmallows and savoury and sweet biscuits can also be added to the care box. I was initially going to drop off the parcels to the homes and run, but now so many people have offered to make muffins, scones and cupcakes so there will be a tea at each home and then every resident will receive their present. lPledges can be made by e-mailing Gouws at sam.gouws@gmail.com before November 30 and Santa shoeboxes can be dropped off at 45 French Street, Cambridge.
