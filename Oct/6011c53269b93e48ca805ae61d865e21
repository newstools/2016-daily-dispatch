The University does not take these incidents lightly and is concerned at the rising number of our students affected by this heinous crime the university said.According to police reports the students had taken a taxi to the Norwich bus station in order to return to university on Wednesday at about 6pm but were instead abducted by the driver to the New Brighton area where both were raped. They were released at 6am the next day and managed to get help at a nearby shopping centre before reporting the crime to the police station.In August three suspects were arrested by police in connection with the hijacking armed robbery rape and murder of two NMMU students earlier that month.
