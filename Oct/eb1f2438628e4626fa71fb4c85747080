Border Bulldogs player, Masixole Banda, has been rewarded for his sparkling and energetic play after a splendid season in the Currie Cup First Division where he was a regular match-winner, helping the Bulldogs reach the semifinals. Banda will contest the Player of the Year award in the First Division with other two nominees in Griffons flyhalf George Whitehead and the Leopards Namibian-born three-quarter Johan Deysel.It was Whitehead s fine goal-kicking which enabled the Griffons to annexe the trophy at Potchefstroom last Friday.The 26-year-old Banda, however, whether playing at flyhalf or fullback, has been strong on both attack and defence, while his trusty boot also managed to garner him plenty of points.The Bulldogs also stunned stronger teams with their attacking play, beating the Lions in their own backyard and the Sharks at home early in the season.Then, against the Valke at Kempton Park, Banda ensured the Bulldogs would reach the semifinals of the First Division with a breathtaking display when he scored two tries and converted seven, amassing 24 points in the game.Few who were at Buffalo City Stadium last month will not forget how Border, with about 10 minutes left for play, were trailing the South-Western Districts Eagles 17-24, and then scored two late tries, each converted by Banda, to give the home team a 3124 triumph. Banda also scored a try kicked over two other conversions and a penalty for a personal tally of 16 points from the game.Of course, there were off-days for Banda as well, when things did not run smoothly. For example, against the Leopards in August in Potchefstroom, he missed a late penalty which would have given Border a vital onepoint victory.Nevertheless, he still managed to score a try and kicked over two conversions in the match but altogether he missed three kicks. The Leopards won the game 26-24. I was very surprised to be nominated as Player of the Year, said Banda. I m very excited, very happy. Banda said of the two positions he starred in this season, he preferred playing flyhalf, as you are more involved in the game .He said he appreciated the fact his teammates have contributed to his success. It has really been a team effort of the Bulldogs which has helped me get the nomination, the modest Banda said.The marketing manager for Border Rugby, Akhona Mgijima, said the union was very proud of Banda, and hopefully he will win this prestigious award for the Bulldogs .He added: This can only do good for Border rugby and will lead to greater success next season .Should Banda win the award, it will cap off a fine season for the slightlybuilt player and possibly attract more sponsorship deals for Border, a team which has rapidly been displaying that they are able to hold their own in the Premier Currie Cup competition.
