Traffic in the Mthatha CBD came to a standstill yesterday as hundreds of civil servants in red T-shirts marched to the offices of the department of health. National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) regional secretary Mthuthuzeli Somkoko said they wanted to demonstrate their anger and dissatisfaction with the way the department handled workers issues.Their grievances and demands include:lAbsorption of community health workers (CHW);lPayment of benefits such as overtime, long service awards, pay progression and housing grants;Somkoko said after a number of engagements with all listed demands the department had failed to implement even a single resolution. What we want to explain, comrades, is that we are dealing with unreasonable people co-opted by a corrupt system. What makes it worse is that we are trying by all means to meet the department halfway but we have no luck, said Somkoko.He said they expected answers and time frames as to when the demands would be met. This is the beginning of our struggle. Failure to meet our demands and our time frames will intensify our programme and [we shall] legally fight to the end, he said.Somkoko said community healthcare workers played an important role in the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) and therefore demanded that these workers be permanently employed. Primary healthcare is a central component of the NHI and this has increased the use of CHW in the delivery of services to communities, so as long as there is a need for them there should be a space for fulltime employment, said Somkoko.He said centralisation of functions to the provincial office had left the district powerless, which essentially delayed services.When a health centre needed to buy medical safety equipment they had to wait for Bhisho to approve the purchase, even though it was located more than 300km from the Bhisho office. Even with paying workers, the district faces problems because they have no authority, he said.Somkoko said the shortage of health equipment in clinics and hospitals was a threat to the NHI programme, especially in the OR Tambo health district, which was a pilot site. The list is endless but we want the department to urgently respond to the above list within 14 days from the date of receipt, failing which they will give us no choice but to declare a dispute, said Somkoko.OR Tambo district health manager Nomvume Ntshanga accepted the memorandum on behalf of superintendent-general Dr Thobile Mbengashe, who will respond. ziphon@dispatch.co.za
