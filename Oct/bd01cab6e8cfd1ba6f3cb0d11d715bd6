Reports have emerged that a lawyer for the South African Revenue Service (Sars) was held hostage in what is seen to be a last-ditch attempt to shore up a faltering fraud case against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. It was claimed that the Sars lawyer who had written the legal opinion on the early retirement and reappointment of former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay which is the basis of the fraud charges was detained by the Hawks lead investigator in the case.The Daily Maverick reported (http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-10-27-game-over-for-abrahams-moyane-and-co-documents-prove-gordhan-prosecution-political/#.WBGCk9V94dU) that Sars deputy director of law administration Vlok Symington was locked inside a boardroom by the Hawks and current Sars commissioner Tom Moyane. The Hawks needed Symington to urgently provide an affidavit with regard to the circumstances under which he wrote the 2009 memo with regard to Ivan Pillay s early retirement the website reported.The Mail &amp; Guardian (http://mg.co.za/article/2016-10-26-hawks-npa-emails-lead-to-hostage-drama-at-sars-office) reported that it had seen cellphone video clips of an altercation between Symington four Hawks officials and the bodyguard .The M&amp; G said Symington s legal opinion stated that there was no technicality that prevented Sars from reappointing Pillay and that he was entitled to request Gordhan (minister of finance at the time during his first round) to waive the early retirement penalty .National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams who made the announcement that Gordhan Pillay and erstwhile Sars colleague Oupa Magashula would be charged has been under pressure from many corners as the case is said to be legally flawed and weak.
