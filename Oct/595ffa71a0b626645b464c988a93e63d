Former David Mama High School pupils Pedrona Mahuwa, Nomgqibelo Gabada, Zimbini Gubevu and Linda Mbolekwa handed over new school uniforms to 30 needy pupils from the Mdantsane-based school yesterday. The former pupils are among a group of 20 that go by the name of David Mama Reunion . They opened a bank account where each member contributed as much as they could to buy new school uniforms for needy pupils.The group approached the school in April wanting to know where they could assist. I would see learners from the school around Mdantsane, some with torn jerseys and broken shoes and I could identify with them because I grew up struggling as well, said Mahuwa. We did not come here today because we are wealthy but because we know what it feels like to have to put cardboard under our broken shoes. Gabada told learners to always try their best regardless of their backgrounds. She also pleaded with learners who were privileged to not laugh or ridicule those that came from disadvantaged homes. When you see something wrong with your fellow peer, call them aside and fix it, but not in front of others. Help them, don t mock them. Teacher Zelda Dobela said they were happy to receive the donations. She said the school had never expected formerpupils to come and plough back. This, she said, proved that they not only taught subjects at the school but also about humanity. She said the pupils selected to receive uniforms were needy pupils in Grades 8 and 10 who showed great commitment to their academics.Thembeka Jadezweni, an emotional grandparent and member of the SGB who was at the handover ceremony to witness her grandchild receive a new uniform, said she was truly grateful for the donation. This child does not have parents and this brings me so much joy and a sense of relief because my grandchild really needed a new uniform. qaqambam@dispatch.co.za
