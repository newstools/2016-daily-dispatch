In a dramatic turn of events, the state has withdrawn charges against former ANC O R Tambo regional chairman Tandekile Sabisa. Sabisa, who also served as O R Tambo district municipality deputy mayor, former ANC deputy regional secretary Lawrence Mambila and their three co-accused Masibonge Mnyanda,Mphumzi Nojoko and Andile Mayisela appeared in the Tsolo Magistrate&#8217;s Court in connection with the murder of current ANC regional chairman Xolile Nkompela&#8217;s bodyguard Zukile Nyontso last year.Nkompela and a second bodyguard were ambushed near Tsolo in December. Nyontso had been driving at the time.The Daily Dispatch has previously reported that Nkompela has always maintained that the bullets that took Nyontso&#8217;s life were intended for him.Reading the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Mthatha Division Barry Madolo, magistrate Jongikhaya Busakwe said prosecution against Sabisa had been declined.&#8220;I decline to prosecute Tandekile Sabisa at this stage. The charges against him must be withdrawn,&#8221; Madolo said in his decision.Meanwhile the case against Mambila, Nojoko and Mnyanda has been referred to the high court.They are facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, unlawful possession of firearms and unlawful possession of ammunition.Busakwe told them they would have to return to court on December 5 to get a high court date.Mayekiso on the other hand will appear in the Qumbu Regional Court on November 14 on charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition.But Sabisa, while speaking to the Dispatch outside the court afterwards, lashed out at ANC leaders who had &#8220;publicly came out and said those who have attempted to kill the regional chairperson are those that have lost the [last year&#8217;s O R Tambo regional] conference.He described such utterances as reckless saying they had heavily influenced the case against them.&#8220;[If you say that] automatically I am implicated because I was contesting the position [of regional party chairman] with comrade Nkompela,&#8221; he said while also condemning the Hawks for arresting him without any proof or evidence.Meanwhile, Nkompela speaking through his lawyer Sigqibo Nkonyeni, said they were disappointed at the withdrawal of the charges against Sabisa without any &#8220;full reasons&#8221; being provided.National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Luxolo Tyali, on the other hand, said the charges against Sabisa were withdrawn due to a lack of evidence linking him to the crime but argued that should evidence come to light, the charges against him could be reinstated by the state.
