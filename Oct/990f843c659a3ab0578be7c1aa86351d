Two of the three men who were assaulted by angry Walter Sisulu University students last night remain in a serious condition in hospital. One of them succumbed to injuries he sustained during the attack that took place at the university&#8217;s Nelson Mandela Drive campus in Mthatha around 9pm last night.They were allegedly assaulted by students who accused them of stealing their property.Department of health spokesman Siyanda Manana said the two men were admitted at Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital with serious injuries. They are very critical and are now undergoing scans. They are unconscious and their identities are not yet known,&#8221; he said. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said they were prevented from entering the premises of the university by students who pelted their car with stones. Police were called for backup, but by the time they arrived one of the three men was already dead, she said.The students took the law into their own hands after the three men were seen in Phulo residents allegedly with student items like laptops.Students are blaming the university management of not providing functional security system for the university premises. People from outside have easy access here, parts of the campus are dark, students get gummed all the time and others attacked in their rooms, student leader Melikhaya Mcitwa said.Mcitwa said they had been raising the security issues with management but nothing had changed.Mcitwa took it to Facebook and wrote: I blame WSU management, particularly office of Chief Operations Officer. You are failing us as students in relation to security system of the university and I personally have a problem with regards to the empty promises (of) improving security system in the past years. Now that there are these (tragic) incidents on campus, it&#8217;s because of your arrogance. The university&#8217;s spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said they were still investigating the matter.
