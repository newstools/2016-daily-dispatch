Buffalo City Metro s executive mayor Xola Pakati brought smiles to the faces of hundreds of sick children by handing out more than 500 gifts in hospitals across the metro. Pakati, his wife Zandile and a number of councillors, including portfolio head of sport and special programmes Xolani Witbooi, attended.Pakati said the metro needed to continue appreciating its residents and children. Being in hospital as a child, who is supposed to be outside playing, should be hard. We are here just to cheer the little ones up and to bring some smiles even though some may be in pain. Pakati and his delegation started distributing the toys at Frere hospital before proceeding to Cecilia Makiwane, Grey in King William s Town and Bhisho hospital.Frere hospital CEO Rolene Wagner said the management at Frere appreciated that Pakati and his family took time out to spread some festive cheer among the children. Today we saw smiles and excitement light up the faces of our patients, their mothers and the Frere staff in the children s wards because mayor Pakati had a kind word and a gentle touch for everyone, she said.Wagner added that being in hospital around Christmas time was a challenge for the young patients. It is never nice for anyone to have to be in a hospital but especially at this time of the year so the visit by the mayor, his family and the BCM team touched our hearts and [this] is a gesture that will always be cherished, said Wagner .At Cecilia Makiwane, Pakati handed over about 150 toys to children ranging from three to 12 years.CMH Dr Luvuyo Bayeni said the visit had done a lot for the healing process of the children at the hospital. We appreciate the visit by the mayor, especially when its focus was on the kids. It has helped us to bring the positive spirit of the patients because a happy patient is a responsive patient, said Bayeni.
