A nine-year-old girl was among a group who took turns overnight to help save a 100kg turtle that washed up at Chintsa West. It took five people to lug the massive sea creature into a bakkie to take it to the East London Aquarium yesterday morning.Nicknamed Toughey, the loggerhead turtle measured about 1m long from head to tail, with a carapace (shell) measuring 86cm.Parts of the Chintsa West community rallied to help as fast as they could after it was found lying upside down on the rocks near the village tidal pool on Tuesday.Beachgoers turned it over and tried to get it afloat along the surf line, but it kept washing up.Resident Andy Miller said he notified BCM chief of marine services Siani Tinley and helped to lift the massive reptile onto a towel and carry it to the tidal pool, where it swam in the shallows.East London Museum principal scientist Kevin Cole said by the time he arrived at the pool, the turtle was looking very fatigued and he coaxed it onto the sand. It fell asleep quite quickly, said Cole, who called the vet at uShaka Marine World in KZN and was advised to let the tired turtle rest overnight.Chintsa West resident Jean Ellingson and her daughter Jor gia, 9, were a part of the all-night turtle protection team. People were trying to jump on it when it was in the tidal pool and I heard people say that turtle soup is very nice, so Jor gia and I and another resident stayed with it in the night to keep it safe. We poured water on it to keep it hydrated. You can t just watch something like that die, she said. We really hope it will go back [to the ocean] and make more turtles. Cole said the creature made a determined effort to make its way out to sea early yesterday morning but rough sea conditions forced it back onto the beach.The decision was then made to transport the loggerhead to the East London Aquarium for rehabilitation.The Daily Dispatch observed as the giant sea reptile was carefully lifted from the back of a bakkie onto a towel and carried by Cole and four aquarium staff members to the nursery in the bowels of the building.Tinley said it was their first turtle of this size at the aquarium, which usually dealt with stranded juveniles and hatchlings.She said Toughey would be kept in shallow water in a cut-off Jojo drum and the aquarium would take guidance from uShaka Marine and Port Elizabeth s Bayworld on its treatment and release.Cole said that while loggerheads, which can grow to a weight of up to 150kg, were removed from the endangered list late last year, they are still listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.He said Toughey appeared to have an eye infection and had two cysts on the upper left body, but would have to be checked for viruses and also for floater syndrome, which is caused by ingested plastic particles that build up gas in the system, causing turtles to float. If it shows no symptoms perhaps it can be taken to Cove Rock, where it can swim into deep water quickly.
