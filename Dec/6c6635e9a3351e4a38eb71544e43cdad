The late President Castro not only identified with the struggle against apartheid but also inspired the Cuban people to join South Africans in that struggle a Presidency statement said. After South Africa gained freedom in 1994 Cuba and South Africa under President Castro and President Nelson Mandela respectively formed a strong bond of solidarity and friendship.
