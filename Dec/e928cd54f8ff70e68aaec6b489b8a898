The prices of basic household items continue to fluctuate as the year draws to a close. Though potatoes were going for an average price of R12.99/kg last month, the price has increased by R1, pushing it to R13.99.In a statement issued in October, agricultural economist Karabo Takadi warned of high potato prices ahead of the festive season due to the drought.According to Takadi, the supply of potatoes is insufficient to meet the current demand and although early season rains are expected, dam levels continue to be low, leading to insufficient water for irrigation.Takadi said both these factors ultimately impacted on yields.Since April, the Saturday Dispatch has charted the prices of eight household items sunflower oil, chicken, bread, milk, eggs, maize meal, potatoes and butternut.The findings are published on the first Saturday of every month and sourced from three different East London supermarkets.Their December prices are:lBrown bread R10.99 a drop from the November price of R11.69;lChicken R40.90/kg, a slight increase from R39.99/kg last month;lMaize meal R12.99/kg, a price which remained the same from last month;lOne litre of milk R11.29, an increase from last month s R10.99 price;lDozen eggs R22.59, a price decrease from R24.99 last month;lPotatoes R13.99, a R1 increase from R12.99/kg;lButternut R17.99, a decrease from R18.99/kg; andl750ml sunflower cooking oil remained at R18.99. zisandan@dispatch.co.za&nbsp;
