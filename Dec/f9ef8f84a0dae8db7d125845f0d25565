The Young Communist League (YCL) in the province is mourning the tragic death of its Ingquza Hill activist who died during a freak truck accident on his return from the league s national council held in Gauteng over the weekend. Sinethemba Cingo, a YCL branch secretary in Lusikisiki, died tragically on Sunday evening when he was hit by a runaway truck on the N3 freeway between Harr i smith and the Montross Shell Garage in KwaZulu &#8211; Natal. This was while more than 60 of his comrades watched in shock and disbelief. Cingo was travelling in a YCL-hired bus with 62 of his comrades from the Alfred Nzo, OR Tambo and Joe Gqabi districts when this tragedy struck. They were travelling from the University of Johannesburg s Soweto campus where the league held its third national council meeting since December 8. According to the league s provincial secretary Andile Mosha, the truck that instantly killed Cingo, did not stop at the accident scene.
