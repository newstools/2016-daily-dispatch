With a critical shortage of dogs for its K9 unit, police have turned to residents and private enterprises to help donate suitable dogs . Yesterday national police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said only dogs aged between nine months and three years would be accepted as the cops hope to increase the operational capacity of the crucial unit.A severe shortage of police dogs would prove costly for the cops in their crime-fighting endeavours as they are used for narcotic detection, explosives detection, protected species detection, biological body fluid detection, currency detection, carcass-and-hide detection.They are also in stock theft investigations, tracking and apprehending of dangerous suspects, fire investigation, including search and rescue operations. The extent of generosity and assistance of the public at large will be the key factor to determine the success of this donation drive and mainly to contribute to ensure that all people in South Africa are and feel safe, said Mohlala, adding that dogs are donated unconditionally to the police.The police are looking for different breeds including border collies, German shepherds, cocker spaniels, labradors, Belgian shepherds, bloodhounds, rottweilers, golden retrievers, German shorthair pointers and Jack Russells.The call for dog donations comes after the parliament s police portfolio committee heard in January that SAPS was facing a critical shortage of dogs.At the time, component head MajorGeneral Michael Motlhala told the committee there were 224 trained K9 handlers without dogs, and 215 old operational dogs were to be boarded.There were also 197 members at different units who would be going through the K9 course, the committee heard.Potential donors in the Eastern Cape can contact Steyn on 074-729-1147 or on 082-343-4838. &nbsp;
