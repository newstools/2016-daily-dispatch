The story of a young Duncan Village boy taking care of his paralysed granny, which tugged at the heartstrings of readers three years ago, has a fairytale ending. Abongile Ganati was just 10 years old back then when the Dispatch reported how he would bathe, dress and feed his ailing grandmother Nokude Ganati, then 55.They lived in a shack in C-Section and the boy would do all the chores while still juggling schoolwork.The pair yesterday moved into a three-bedroom house in Chicken Farm, handed over by the department of social development.The house is disabled-friendly, thanks to Good Samaritan Mandla Makinana, who donated special fittings for the house and all the furniture.Ganati could not hold back her tears as she was ushered into her new home by social development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi and other officials. I can t even express how I am feeling at the moment, said Ganati.The two were welcomed into the community by their new neighbours, led in song by a brass band organised by Makinana.Makinana said he was approached by social development to donate whatever he could afford. I have experienced poverty. However, I was especially touched by the story of a 10-year-old boy who gave up his childhood to become a man when required, said Makinana.Abongile, now 13, had to care for his beloved granny since she was confined to a wheelchair following a motor vehicle accident in 2010. She also suffered a stroke in 2012.Abongile s father and an uncle were both serving lengthy jail terms while a second uncle Ganati s youngest son Olwethu was out most of the time in search of work and not living with them.Makinana, who met the Ganatis for the first time yesterday, said he wanted to make their lives better. We have installed a ramp to allow easy mobility, said Makinana.Sihlwayi said that the department had been in consultation with the Road Accident Fund and other government departments in addressing the needs of Ganati. The RAF has offered to pay for a caregiver and the department of social development will continue with providing the disability grant and the foster care grant that it has been offering the family, said Sihlwayi. simthandilef@dispatch.co.za&nbsp;
