The Hawks have arrested three senior traffic officers including their senior superintendent in Peddie earlier today for fraud. They are accused of taking bribes from motorists. The three, who work at the Ngqushwa Municipality&#8217;s traffic department, are currently at the Peddie Magistrate&#8217;s C ourt facing fraud charges. Hawks spokeswoman Anelisa Feni said the unit would release a full statement at a later stage. The Hawks swooped on two of the suspects while they were on duty. A third suspect , who is a superintendent , was on leave. She was arrested from her home v illage of Sheshegu near Alice where she had attended a traditional ceremony organised by her family. The Dispatch overheard angry Hawks officers instructing the woman over the phone to save yourself from being embarrassed in front of your family and drive to Peddie . After a short conversation among themselves, the officers later decided to fetch her. The small dusty town of Alice came to a standstill this morning after a convoy of Hawks cars flew in. Sounds of wailing sirens echoed across the sleepy town leaving everyone into a curious state.
