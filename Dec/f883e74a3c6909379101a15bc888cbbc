Emergency rescue personnel yesterday battled rough, mountainous terrain in a bid to rescue three herdsmen who fell down a deep gorge on Blinkwater farm near Fort Beaufort soon after midnight yesterday. The farm, also known as Gqugesi, is about 25km north of Fort Beaufort. Two police helicopters and one from Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were sent to assist in the search.&nbsp;&nbsp;
