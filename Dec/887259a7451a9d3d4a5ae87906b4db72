Women and girl children including the elderly must feel safe in the sanctuary of their homes and free to walk their streets as well as neighbourhoods at any time of day without looking over their shoulders in fear of being victims of vile and despicable acts he said.The Nelspruit Regional Court on Thursday established that on December 30 2012 at around 2am the victim was asleep at her home in Pienaar just outside Mbombela and was woken up by a noise.
