By ZIPO-ZENKOSI NCOKAZIMthatha residents who buy bottled water can now brag that they are drinking mineral water sourced from their own area and bottled by two enterprising teenagers. AquaTK a new brand found at a major food retail store in the bustling town of Mthatha is 100% owned by two teenage pupils who were born in the area.Kanya Mngqibisa, 16, and Thando Phantsi, 17, recently launched AquaTK, a pioneering brand of quality bottled mineral water which is fast gaining popularity.Speaking to the Daily Dispatch this week, the Grade 11 St Johns College pupils said they had always been interested in business, and earlier this year they decided they wanted to infiltrate a growing industry.Kanya said their business was the result of a thorough market analysis that showed that there were not many black-owned manufacturing companies, especially in the Eastern Cape. We found that the bottled water industry is growing at 12% annually and that is about twice as fast as other beverages. With the rising popularity of healthier lifestyle choices, we realised that this industry had high profit margins, Kanya said.Their entire water plant operates from Mthatha and pumps up to 8000 litres of water a day.Thando said after they had decided on the water business, the hardest part was breaking into the market and finding capital. We had three choices get government funding, a bank loan or an investor. We chose the last option, because this meant we would be working with someone who not only has resources but knows people and already understands how business works. He said they had already raised R20000 from other entrepreneurial ventures, which included selling everything from T-shirts and cooldrinks and helping small companies with graphic design and website development.Their investor provided them with the space for their project as well as the necessary machinery, which was made available after a previous plant owner did not fare that well with a similar venture.Kanya and Thando have dreams of creating business empires, and they plan to employ many people and conquer other provinces.Spargs Spar manager Collin Tutton said the pair had introduced themselves to him last month, and he was so impressed with their initiative he bought 10 cases of 5l bottles which sold out in a week. Bottled water is becoming big business. We have doubled our order with them and we will then take things from there, but so far our customers have really taken well to their product, Tutton said. ziphon@dispatch.co.za
