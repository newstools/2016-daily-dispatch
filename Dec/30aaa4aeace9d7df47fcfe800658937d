Sunrise-on-sea sea artist Jeff Rankin has made it possible for everyday folk to enjoy his Eastern Cape woodcuts some of which were originally 50m long by producing four different 2017 calendars featuring his work. I wanted to make the work accessible, said Rankin. Most of the work in the calendars has been sold, so this is a good way to keep it alive, plus I really love the idea of artist books and limited edition self-publishing. One of the calendars features works recently produced for the cutting-edge resource centre addition to the St Elizabeth s Hospital in Lusikisiki, where Rankin created massive woodcut images of iconic rural scenes which span the upper reaches of the atrium. They are very popular images of the Transkei and people are drawn to them, said Rankin about the woodcuts, which include a woman carrying firewood, pecking hens and a man on horseback.A satiric look at the issue of domestic workers in South Africa is the focus of another of Rankin s calendars.Taken from a very limited edition artist book he created for a Durban exhibition in 2007 called the Domestic Worker s Visual A to Z, the drawings are executed with a cartoonist s eye and a good dose of dark humour. The drawings convey that nothing has changed for domestic workers in South Africa. It s about the neverending plight of unskilled workers. This theme extends to another of Rankin s calendars called Men Leaving, which is based on photographs he took at Port St Francis of fishermen going to work. There was a poignancy to them because they were leaving their families for a few days of hard and dangerous work. Another of his calendars is illustrated with woodcut prints inspired by road trips through the Pondoland.
