The bail application by a Rhodes University student accused of masterminding the murder of a Grahamstown man he suspected of stealing his laptop was thrown a curveball when the state asked if they could introduce new evidence. Plans by magistrate Lindelwa Figlan to deliver judgment in Thembani Onceya&#8217;s bail application were put on hold until tomorrow when prosecutor Lyle Prins said it was in the interests of justice to further delay the hearing. Onceya&#8217;s dismayed attorney Basil Williams today said Prins&#8217; request to reopen the state&#8217;s case was &#8220;quite shocking&#8221;. Vowing to object, he said Prins was being unprofessional. Onceya, 28, was arrested early last month when he went to hand himself over to police following the discovery of Thembalani Qwakanisa&#8217;s battered body wrapped in a carpet in a dam in Joza. The third &#8211; year anthropology and Xhosa student was being sought by police after they arrested two of his brothers and two friends for the alleged torture and murder of Qwakanisa. The horrific murder caused shockwaves in the community.
