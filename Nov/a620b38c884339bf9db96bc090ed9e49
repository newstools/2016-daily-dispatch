A fued between former Eastern Cape finance MEC Billy Nel and a tenant he had been battling to evict from his Shadow Park compound outside Gonubie has been resolved. Nel, 73, has allowed Gavin May, his wife Janet Bezuidenhout and their three children, who are tenants in one of 13 units at his Quenera riverside property, to stay on after previously trying to evict them.Nel on Friday replaced the roof and reconnected the water and electricity supply to their house.Nel said he felt sorry for the family. The whole thing was unnecessary. We have given him another lifeline and we ve said never mind paying the money he owes, said Nel. I understand that he is going through hard times. However, I can t let people stay for free at that place because my electricity bill there is R14 000 a month. I hope he pays his rent. In October the couple and their three children, aged six, four and three, slept in the kitchen of the house after Nel took the roof off and ordered them to leave.Nel accused the couple of defaulting on their rent payments. However, May and Bezuidenhout said their payments were up to date.Speaking to the Dispatch yesterday, Bezuidenhout said a meeting had been called by Nel s son Kevin where it was announced they would be allowed to stay on. Kevin also announced that he had taken over the running of the park with immediate effect and he was sorry about everything, said Bezuidenhout.Their October rent was also waived after they refused to pay, arguing that they lived in a roofless house with no electricity and water.Kevin Nel, who owns KRN property management, said he had offered to run the place for his father. My father is getting old and his health is deteriorating, he said. I suppose he was hasty in trying to resolve the dispute with the tenant, but he is good guy, he has donated a lot to that family before. Kevin said his father didn t have time to run the property, which he bought in 1982.
