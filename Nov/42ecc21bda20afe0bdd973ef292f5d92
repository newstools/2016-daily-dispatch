Insects consumption could become a sustainable food source in Africa, according to a presentation by a Zimbabwean agricultural food expert at the food security in Africa conference. The conference , which is being held in the International Convention Centre in East London , is a first of its kind in the country and is organised by the University of Fort Hare in partnership with the University of Pretoria. It is aimed at finding solutions on food sustainability and security for the ever &#8211; growing population in the continent amid environmental changes challenges and geopolitical issue such as land grabs. It is being attended by food security specialists from Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Burundi, Lesotho, Swaziland, Sudan, Nigeria, Mauritius, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa. Dr Robert Musundire of the Zimbabwe&#8217;s Chinhoyi University of Technology said the idea of eating insects was not far-fetched as people from his country and northern parts of South Africa were already eating these for dietary purposes. Food is food, in good years you have rice, you have mealie m ea l, and insects are just one of the options. We are not saying they are going to solve food insecurity but we are putting them in the basket of options. So we are saying if we develop value chain for insects they become a good option during hardships just like any other food commodity, Musundire said.
