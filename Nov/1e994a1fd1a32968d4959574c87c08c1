The second phase of an R187-million expansion project to the Reeston Wastewater Treatment Works was launched yesterday to bring relief to East London s overloaded treatment system. Already R101-million has been spent on the civil construction phase with the work completed last month, and R86-million will now be spent on the electrical and mechanical phase.This phase was launched yesterday by Buffalo City Metro (BCM) mayor Xola Pakati and is expected to start in February next year. It will create 80 job opportunities.Wastewater from the East London central business district, Amalinda and other surrounding areas will, after the completion of the project, be diverted and treated at Reeston.Pakati said BCM wanted to improve the city s aging infrastructure. We want to improve basic sanitation in the city and to ensure that we are able to accommodate new communities with our infrastructure. This is meant to service not only the Reeston community, but greater East London too, as our residents are increasing on a daily basis and our infrastructure is currently not meant to service so many people, Pakati said.The project will see the capacity of the Reeston treatment works increase from processing 2.5 megalitres a day to 12.5 megalitres.BCM acting engineering head Luyanda Mbula said the diversion of wastewater from the central wastewater treatments works also formed an important component in the Duncan Village development framework as it sought to alleviate overloading at the central wastewater works. [It will] release capacity for development of housing in the central drainage zone and provide infrastructure that will cater for the treatment of wastewater for the central drainage zone in its future. The extension of the Reeston WWTW [wastewater treatment works] is therefore a critical component in unlocking development potential in the central drainage zone, Mbula said, adding that about 300 people were employed during the civil phase of the project.Some of the 28 village areas added to the new BCM demarcation are also expected to be serviced through the Reeston site.Two new road construction vehicles were also unveiled yesterday as part of the council s first 100 days in office programme.BCM, working with the office of the premier, also announced that 18 young people would be trained in various skills like motor mechanics, fitting and turning, panel beating and automotive repairs. mamelag@dispatch.co.za
