Would-be AbaThembu king, prince Mankunku Mthandeni Jongisizwe Dalindyebo s high court bid to stop the coronation of his nephew, Azenathi Dalindyebo, as acting king of the Thembus will be heard on Wednesday. The matter was supposed to be heard today but there were difficulties in sourcing a judge to hear the urgent application. Azenathi is the son of Mthatha High Court Judge Buyiswa Majiki. Attempts to source an out-of-province judge to hear the matter at such short notice proved difficult. High court registrar Janet Wilson yesterday confirmed that Grahamstown High Court judge Gerald Bloem would preside on Wednesday. The prince, who is King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo s younger brother, is seeking to halt any preparation for the coronation, or any other action or meeting intended to recognise Azenathi as the acting king. Manku n ku believes he should be crowned acting king while Dalindyebo serves out his 12-year prison sentence.
