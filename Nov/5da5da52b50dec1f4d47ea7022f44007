The widow of slain South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani lashed out at the The Star newspaper for what she said was shoddy journalism and false claims which lent credence to malicious rumours about certain African National Congress (ANC) comrades. Speaking at a City of Ekurhuleni event commemorating the life of Chris Hani on Thursday in Boksburg Limpho Hani said this did not sit well with her. In today s The Star page one I read that there s a documentary about my husband and I don t know who are the people who are doing the documentary. They have not talked to the ANC SACP and they have not talked to me. But what I find very strange and extremely offensive [when] you read that story there is no story. But what has offended me is that the name of our former president Thabo Mbeki is mentioned there said Dimpho.Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina officially received the keys to the house of the late struggle icon. The house has been purchased by the city as part of its programme to preserve history and heritage.Among the possible uses for the house which has been in private hands since Hani s death is to turn it into a museum where people can learn more about the life and times of the SAPC leader who was gunned down in the property s driveway in 1993. I appeal to the editor of The Star not to sell his newspapers by throwing our leaders names in vain Limpho Hani pleaded.She said she would be taking legal steps against the newspaper.It is not the first time she has lashed out at the media.During an address to alliance leaders at the unveiling of a monument to honour her late husband also in Boksburg in April last year she said that a woman who claimed to be her late husband s daughter was actually from Mozambique and the Department of Home Affairs had confirmed that he was not her father.She said she suspected the stories were given credence by people trying to perpetuate a stereotype that black people were corrupt and had no morals
