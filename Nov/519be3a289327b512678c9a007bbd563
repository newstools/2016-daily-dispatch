The cat will finally be out of the bag when Golden Gloves Promotions (GGP) in association with SuperSport officially announce the boxing tribute tournament for Mzi Mnguni at an East London restaurant today. The tournament scheduled for November 20 has been kept under wraps while GGP was busy with other events such as their tournament, which featured Duncan Village boxer Siyabonga Siyo against Hekkie Budler.The show took place at Emperors Palace on October 22 and saw SA boxer Kevin Lerena being crowned the Cruiserweight Super Four champion after beating Dane Micki Nielsen.Just when GGP boss Rodney Berman was beginning to take a breather he had to accompany his other charge Xolisani Nomeva Ndongeni, who incidentally hails from the Eastern Cape.Ndongeni was fighting in US where he made a successful debut by beating Mexican Juan Garcia Mendez in Corona last weekend.Now Berman s focus will shift to East London, where he plans to promote a blockbuster show to pay homage to his long-time ally Mnguni, who is recuperating from a massive heart attack.Berman did not want to officially confirm the tournament until he had tied down all details including the boxers scheduled to fight on the undercard.However he admitted that the show will be topped by the IBO mini-flyweight title clash between Mthatha-born Simpiwe Konkco and former Mnguni charge Nkosinathi Mabere Joyi.The fight has a resonance with Mnguni as Joyi won his first world title under the legendary promoter s tutelage.Joyi will now be fighting for the very same title he used as a springboard to bigger things.So confident is Joyi of regaining his crown that he revealed that he would even enter the ring on a motorbike as he used to do in all his fights.There are also plans to have him wear the same boxing shorts he used in his triumph over Filipino Armando dela Cruz, whom he knocked out in two rounds to become the IBO king way back at a Berman promoted show at Emperors Palace in 2004. I cannot wait to regain my title from Konkco, said Joyi. Konkco is a good guy and as you know we were once promoted by the same promoter but he will forgive me for taking back what is mine. Today s presser is expected to unveil other boxers to feature in the historic show which is expected to draw the who s who of the political, community and entertainment world.Berman has promised to donate all proceeds of the tournament to Mnguni, who is expected to be present at today s presser.
