In a twist on the troubled path to appoint a new AbaThembu king, jailed King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo now says he does not want his brother or son to wear the crown. The king was speaking through a spokesman, Prince Mthunzi Ngonyama, at the Grahamstown High Court where the battle along with curious crowds moved yesterday. Legal counsel yesterday landed verbal blows in court in the next round of a bruising royal boxing match which will continue there today.The issue is who will ascend the abaThembu throne while the king serves his jail time.Prince Mankunku Mthandeni Dalindyebo yesterday asked the Grahamstown High Court to interdict the planned coronation on Friday of his nephew and heir apparent, Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo.In a dramatic on-again, off-again day, the court case hovered at the doors of the Grahamstown High Court yesterday while a judge who could hear it was being sourced.Azenathi s mother is Mthatha High Court Judge Buyiswa Majiki, which was why Mkankunku felt the matter should be heard in Grahamstown.Yesterday, it seemed that King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, who is serving a 12-year stint in jail, could also wade into the fray.Ngonyama said the king, although not cited as a respondent or an interested party in the matter, would want his say.He said the king would like to have time to read through the submissions of both his son and his brother.Ngonyama said the king had already indicated to Azenathi, who is a student at a Free State institution, that he was concerned he would not cope with both his studies and the kingship. His intention is to interdict any coronation by either his brother or by his son. Yesterday, Grahamstown High Court Judge Gerald Bloem was all set to hear the matter today.Azenathi s counsel, advocate Nkokheli Vuba, yesterday asked that his client be given an opportunity to respond to Mankunku s replying affidavit, which he claimed had raised new material.But Mankunku s counsel, advocate Matthew Mpahlwa, said there was no formal application before the court either to file more affidavits or for the matter to be postponed.He said the court would be hamstrung by further delays as judgment had to be given before the coronation, leaving the judge with very little time to draft his ruling.Judge Bloem asked Mpahlwa whether he would accept another affidavit being filed from Azenathi.But Mpahlwa said it was impossible to tell whether or not he would oppose an application to file further affidavits because he did not know what its merits might be.An irate Bloem postponed the matter to today and asked counsel to sort out what issues would be argued by 9.30am.
