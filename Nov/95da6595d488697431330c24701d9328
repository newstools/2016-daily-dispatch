East London singer Jaco Pretorius, better known as Justine Illusion, will be performing his life story tonight at Legends Showcase. Pretorius said the show would take viewers on a journey of his life. It will be a drag-queen extravaganza, an androgynous journey through the stages of my life, my life experiences, that has brought me to this point of illumination. This show is very interactive and it s for everybody, he said.Reflecting on the first show he did in 2013, Pretorius said it was an epic fail. It was such a mess because I did not know anything about showbiz but things have since changed. I have grown and understand how this business works, he said.After East London, Pretorius said he would be taking his show to various cities around South Africa.He said Port Elizabeth and Cape Town were among the first cities that would get a taste of his latest creation. I ve realised in life that when you focus on everything that is at hand, things work out for your good. You are also able to find your purpose in life. I love the space that I am in and I cannot wait to take my show to the whole world. Although he would not give out dates, Pretorius said he would embark on an international tour in the next couple of months. I am on a eat, pray, love journey and finding myself and I am enjoying this journey. I cannot wait to reach my full potential in life.
