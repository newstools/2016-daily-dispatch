University of the Witwatersrand Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini will appear again on Tuesday in the Johannesburg Central Magistrate s Court. Dlamini 30 was arrested on October 15 at his Wits residence and is facing charges of public violence theft malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.Last week advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi appeared for Dlamini at a sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court and secured him bail of R2000. The student activist had spent three weeks in custody.They argued that Dlamini s arrest and prosecution was as a part of a political conspiracy basing their argument on a meeting that took place at the African National Congress Luthuli House headquarters involving National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Kevin Abrahams on 10 October.
