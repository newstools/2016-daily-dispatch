Public p rotector (PP) Busisiwe Mkhwebane must release former PP Thuli Madonsela s report into the estimated R35-million intended for the Mandela memorial which was funne l led through the East Cape Development Corporation (ECDC). Presenting a fresh new approach, the ECDC board chairman Nhlanganiso Dladla, with most of his board around him, today called for the release of the report. He told the media yesterday: The p ublic p rotector s report would help a great deal in telling the story from an objective point of view. He said many people in the corporation were thoroughly inte r rogated and we were comfortable that the organisation cannot be tainted with having siphoned the funds. We feel we are clean and we are comfortable in that regard. We await an objective position on the matter from outside. It is not enough to just say it ourselves because the issue has been in the public domain.
