Chippa United will not be playing at the Buffalo City Stadium in East London against Cape Town City this month as had been initially scheduled. Instead, that match has since been moved to Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth.This was revealed by the Premier Soccer League (PSL), saying that the field is just not up to scratch to host top flight matches.To add salt to the wound, the PSL is expected to check Sisa Dukashe Stadium today ahead of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) festival scheduled for December 3 and 4.Sisa Dukashe in Mdantsane failed the PSL test a few weeks ago and should that be the case again today the MDC festival will be moved to another province.PSL head of communications Luxolo September said they had to move the Chippa match to Port Elizabeth since Buffalo City Stadium does not meet the standards. The PSL has identified things such as the pitch and concerns about turnstile entry points, among other issues, said September.Asked why they allowed Chippa to play no less than three matches at the East London venue last season, September said they gave it the green light with reservations that the situation was going to improve.But more than five months later, the situation remains the same.September could not shed light on what the PSL decision meant for the other four league matches Chippa had scheduled for Buffalo City.However, he said it would be difficult for PSL teams to have a change of venue request approved in the future, with the controlling body tightening up the rules in this regard.As for the MDC, it was up to the municipality to do what they have to do to pass the test.The Daily Dispatch has learnt that KwaZulu-Natal is the PSL s plan B.September said: I do not want to sound like we do not have confidence in the municipality [BCM] by saying we have an alternative venue. Let us rather wait for the inspection to happen so we can have a clear picture of what is going to happen in this regard. With the Chippa match gone and the MDC festival hanging in the balance, the future of sport tourism in the BCM could not be in greater trouble.The local economy, which was to receive a major boost from the two events, will suffer.In a dramatic turn of events, BCM spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said they were not aware of any match between Chippa United and Cape Town City scheduled for 19 November 2016 .This is in contrast with the statement made by Sthembiso Khanyile, a manager in the office of the executive mayor Xola Pakati, in September confirming the match and describing it as a perfect platform for economic spin-offs, promotion of social cohesion and a booming tourism in the metro.Cindi also revealed that BCM does not do maintenance work at Buffalo City Stadium, which he said the municipality had leased to the Border Rugby Union.On Sisa Dukashe, Cindi said the stadium was ready to pass the test. zingisam@dispatch.co.za
