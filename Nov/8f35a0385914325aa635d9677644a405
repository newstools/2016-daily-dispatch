King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo s younger brother Prince Mankunku Mthandeni Jongisizwe Dalindyebo has filed an urgent application before the Grahamstown High Court to stop the coronation of Azenathi Dalindyebo as acting king of the Thembus. The coronation, to be preceded by the royal wedding of Azenathi to Ongezwa Zwedala this weekend, is set for November 25.After having considered the certificate of urgency placed before him on Monday, Grahamstown High Court Judge Murray Lowe set the matter down to be heard on November 22 and gave the respondents until today to file a notice to oppose.In his application Mankunku cited seven respondents including Azenathi, his uncle Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo, Chief Thandisizwe Mtirara, Chief Dumisani Zwelenqaba Mgudlwa, Chief Zwelodumo Mtirara, premier Phumulo Masualle and Cogta MEC Fikile Xasa.According to court papers served on the various respondents, Mankunku wants to halt any preparation for or organisation of events that may conclude in a coronation, or any other action or meeting intended to recognise Azenathi as the acting king. I submit that it is unlawful and contra bonis mores for respondents to seek to organise a coronation for [Azenathi]. The respondents can never allege that I acted improperly by rushing to court without making a full calculation as to the true facts and circumstances of [their conduct], said Mankunku in his application.A number of reports from the Daily Dispatch and other media sources were attached to the application.Mankunku further said the respondents must refrain from publicising the matter. The respondents must observe and respect the resolution of the Ngangelizwe royal family passed on October 21 which approved my appointment as the acting king of abaThembu, said Mankunku.He said they must also honour the October 13 Tolo Commission recommendation that found Mankunku the most suitable member of the royal family for the position of acting king.Mankunku also wants Masualle and Xasa to be ordered not to recognise Azenathi, or alternatively to expunge the recognition from their records if steps have already been taken to recognise him.Mankunku also requested the matter be heard outside of Mthatha as Azenathi s mother Queen Nocollege Dalindyebo also known as Judge Buyiswa Majiki is a Mthatha High Court judge.Ngangelizwe royal family chairman Chief Thanduxolo Mtirara yesterday confirmed they were taking the matter court. AbaThembu acting king Jongisizwe decide to approach the court after noticing that there was some sort of confusion caused by Azenathi and his faction claiming to be acting king. We cannot have two acting kings for one throne. This never happened in any other kingdom, said Mtirara.He said when Mankunku was identified and a resolution taken for him to be acting king on October 21, almost all the royal houses that make up the Ngangelizwe Royal house were present, except one. Although we are not afraid of anything as we know how genuine our royal family is, we decided to approach the court instead of sitting down and not officially objecting to the illegal gathering of these people. We cannot have two bulls in one kraal, said Mtirara.He said according to the custom of the abaThembu, a regent or acting king or queen did not go through an inauguration or coronation ceremony.He slammed the Azenathi faction for introducing foreign customs .Speaking on behalf of the Azenathi faction yesterday, Chief Dumisani Mgudlwa said he was aware some people had been served with papers. We will oppose as a matter of urgency, he said. We will defend the throne of Zwelibanzi [King Dalindyebo] and Prince Azenathi will ensure that it remains intact until his father comes back, said Mgudlwa.Mankunku is represented by advocate Matthew Mpahlwa with the joint instructing attorney being Mqheke Attorneys and Mgangatho Attorneys &amp; Co. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
