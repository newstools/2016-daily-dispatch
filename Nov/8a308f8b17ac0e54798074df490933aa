Dozens of mourners braved Saturday s chilly weather to pay their last respects to jazz legend Pinise Saul. Saul, born on December 31 1944, died in London last month after a long battle with cancer.Her funeral service was held at the East London City Hall.Saul s granddaughter Viwe Mfazi said the family was pleased the body could be repatriated in a short space of time.Pinise s body arrived in the Eastern Cape on Friday with help from the Department of Arts and Culture. These things can take a long time. She was a pillar of strength to us in the family We were so close she did things [for me] that even my mother could not do, Mfazi said. She was supportive and even when I made mistakes in life, she always encouraged me. I am happy that she is home and at peace, but I am also sad that she is gone. As a family we do not know how we are going to pull through, but we know God is on our side, Mfazi added.Saul s talent was discovered by Duncan Village-born legendary jazz pianist Tete Mbambisa, who said her death was not only a loss to her family, but the music industry and the entire country. I met her in the early 1960s. I liked her approach to music. I had a music group and I invited her to sing one song but she exceeded all my expectations, Mbambisa said. She was very talented. She was always jolly and full of jokes. She mastered the African beat, Mbambisa added.Mourners were serenaded by Saul s fellow singers who wanted to honour her one last time.The Eastern Cape-born songbird once shared a stage with Bob Marley and Patti LaBelle. siyab@dispatch.co.za
