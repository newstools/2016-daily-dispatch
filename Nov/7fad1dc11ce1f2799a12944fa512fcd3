Buffalo City Metro has been given R2.4-million by the department of public works to launch a unit to fight and combat crime in the city s 70km coastal belt. Over the years coastal hangout spots have been occupied by armed criminals who pounce on unsuspecting victims.In January two men stabbed and killed popular St George s Presbyterian Church Reverend Clifford Leeuw at Waterworld near Leaches Bay.Leeuw was stabbed in the neck and arm for his cellphone and money.After the attack he managed to get into his vehicle and drive to Cove Rock Estate, where he fell unconscious and died.BCM spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said the new Coastal Protection Unit was being formed to combat these types of attacks among others.A group of 50 Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Azania People s Liberation Army (APLA) Military Veterans have been selected to form part of the unit to be launched next month.The unit will guard against poaching and violent crimes along the metro s coast.Unit members were inducted in the Gonubie Council Chamber yesterday.BCM has partnered with the department of public works and the South African Military Veterans Association.The initiative is funded by the public works through the department s Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). An amount of R2.4-million has been set aside for the unit which will go towards stipends and other operational costs. The department has recruited former liberation soldiers who are unemployed. They will be equipped with skills to protect our coastline. They will be skilled to identify and fight poaching and also assist in fighting crime for 24 hours especially in the festive season, Cindi said.He said with the current budget, the initiative will run until the end of March next year unless BCM managed to get more sponsors on board. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
