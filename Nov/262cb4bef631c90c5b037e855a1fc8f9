Two separate cases of crimen injuria were opened with East London police yesterday after a local businessman allegedly called a local church founder a k****r after the latter had called him umlungu. Thobela Macozoma of the Beacon Bay-based Well of Bethesda Bible Church and Roy Pape, the owner of Gearbox Man Towing and Recovery, have both laid complaints against the other.Macozoma, a former police sergeant, alleges that Pape called him a k****r and black baboon when he found him leaning on his 4X4 Toyota bakkie outside a car workshop.Pape admitted to racially abusing Macozoma and said this was after the latter had called him umlungu (white man) which he found offensive. I come a long time my friend if I am a mlungu then he is a k****r. When in the police station he called me umlungu and I said to him if I am umlungu then he is a k****r we just get one thing straight, Pape said.Macozoma denied calling Pape an umlungu and instead said he called him a boer during their argument.Said Macozoma: I took my car for a service at the Alex Motors workshop in Goodshed Cambridge. I was in the company of my wife [former East London police Lieutenant-Colonel Zodwa Macozoma]. It was just after 7am when we arrived to find the place still closed. There was a workshop employee standing outside the gate so I left my car to go chat with him. Macozoma said he unwittingly leaned against a silver bakkie while in conversation with the Alex Motors employee.He said a few minutes later when Pape, driving a truck, stopped next to him and asked: What the f**k are you doing leaning on my vehicle? Can you even manage to buy that car? Pape owns the business next door.Macozoma said he had apologised to Pape and then asked him not to swear as he found it offensive. He then got off his truck and he came charging to me. He immediately told me listen here k****r . I then said if you are calling me k****r I will call you a boer. And he said listen here black baboon . Macozoma said he told Pape he did not belong in South Africa. He then started saying I will sjambok you and he went to his car and he took out a sjambok and waved it in my face, said Macozoma.Contacted for his side of the story, Pape asked: How am I racist if he is lying on top of my van? Do I go lie on top of his van? The minute you say something to a black man it is always racist because there is a certain amount of arrogance in them. I am in your vehicle and you ask me to get off, I am going to get off. The guy insulted my van and me. If he wants to take it the whole way we can take it the whole way. The man dented the fender with his fat arse and I m still going to charge him for that. Police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi said no arrests had been made yet. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
