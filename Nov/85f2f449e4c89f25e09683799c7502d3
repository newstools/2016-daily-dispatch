Newlywed AbaThembu prince Azenathi Dalindyebo s ambitions to ascend the nation s throne have been been dealt a blow after a letter emerged revealing that Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen had backed the findings of the Tolo Commission. The commission was formed earlier this year to investigate who the rightful person was to act as king while Azenathi s father, King Buyelkhaya Dalindyebo, completed a 12-year prison sentence.Dalindyebo was jailed after being found guilty of charges including arson, assault and attempted murder. The commission recommended that his brother prince Mthandeni Jongisizwe Mankunku Dalindyebo be appointed acting king.The letter from Van Rooyen was submitted as part of supplementary court documents to the Grahamstown High Court in a bid to stop Azenathi s coronation this week.In the letter Van Rooyen recommends that the AbaThembu royal house accept the findings of the Tolo commission. The letter is addressed to the acting chairman of the AbaThembu royal house, chief Mfundo Bhovulengwe Mtirara.It was filed on Friday, the same day Azenathi married Ongezwa Zwedala ahead of his coronation, scheduled for this Friday.An extract from Van Rooyen s letter, of which the Daily Dispatch is in possession, reads: The commission has finalized its investigation and the report has been forwarded to the premier for consideration and further processing. On behalf of the government, I request [the] Royal Family to accept the findings of the commission and the kingship of AbaThembu is restored to where it belongs in terms of service delivery. Mankunku filed an urgent court application last week interdicting the coronation of Azenathi, who will be in the Grahamstown High Court tomorrow to oppose it.The Department of Traditional Affairs was called on by the Abathembu royal house to intervene in the traditional leadership dispute after three factions nominated three different people to act for the incarcerated Dalindyebo.One group, led by chief Thanduxolo Mxolisi Mtirara, nominated Mankunku while another, led by Thanduxolo s younger brother chief Thandisizwe Monwabisi Mtirara, chose Azenathi.A third group has backed Azenathi s stepmother Queen Nokwanda Dalindyebo for the role.The Tolo Commission found that in Abathembu genealogy it has always been the younger brother of the king who takes over in the event that the king cannot perform his duties.The commission also found that Azenathi s mother was never ranked as a royal wife in accordance with the customary law of the AbaThmbu, and therefore her son does not qualify to be king. The documents before the court state that the Abathembu custom dictates that a son cannot occupy the position of his father while the father is still alive.Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle s spokeswoman Mandisa Titi acknowledged receiving e-mailed questions regarding the court action from the Dispatch. She promised to respond but had not done so at the time of writing yesterday.Both traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa and his spokesman Mamkeli Ngam s phones rang unanswered yesterday while Mfundo Mtirara could not be reached either.Meanwhile, Azenathi has filed an urgent application in the Mthatha High Court against his stepmother accusing her of locking him out of Bumbane Great Place. He was last week granted an interim order granting his access. He is expected back in court this week to finalise the application. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
