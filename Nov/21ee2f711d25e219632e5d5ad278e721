Real men don t rape, real men don t abuse and real men don t do drugs. That was the strong message shared by hundreds of Eastern Cape men who took part in the first ever Man on a Mission provincial march organised by East London s local hero, Thabo Mkhencele.He and 11 other Good Samaritans were celebrated on Thursday evening as part of the Daily Dispatch and Johnson &amp; Johnson glitzy gala dinner.The dinner was held at the East London International Conventional Centre, where tears of joy and sadness filled the room as more than 400 people heard the stories of the top 12 local heroes.Following the celebration, Mkhencele continued with his good work yesterday when he led about 200 men and women from different walks of life in the march against the abuse of women and children in the province.The march started near the Buffalo City College and was among many taking place as the country launches the 16 Days of Activism against the abuse of women and children.The men and women marched to the East London City Hall where they were supposed to hand over a memorandum to BCM mayor Xola Pakati.However, Pakati was not available to receive their memorandum and mayoral committee member Xolani Witbooi stood in for him. We wanted to awaken our men on the issue of abuse and crime as we are the perpetrators of these crimes, said Mkhencele. As men we are not doing anything to bring men together to call on them to stop these drugs and abuse. We are not just saying they must stop but we are saying we are here to assist them in making sure that they stop. He said the non-profit Man on a Mission started operating in Duncan Village earlier this year and assisted men with drug rehabilitation, fatherhood and manhood mentorship, among other skills.As part of the march the men called for the end of drug abuse and rape culture outside the California night club in North End, which was burnt by angry residents in March following the death of a Pefferville woman, Nandipha Vaaltyn.She allegedly died due to a drug overdose while in the company of men drinking at the club.The men also called on BCM to strictly enforce by-laws against those who continued to put up posters advertising penis enlargement and abortion in the city. We are of the view that stickers are not promoting the wellbeing of our citizens and may affect tourism as they make our beautiful city look dirty and unlawful, read the memorandum.Witbooi said the city welcomed the march. What you are doing is not only in defence of our women but you are also protecting the city from big companies that are leaving the city. It is the responsibility of us as residents to protect this city, he said. mamelag@dispatch.co.za with additional reporting by Mbali Tanana
