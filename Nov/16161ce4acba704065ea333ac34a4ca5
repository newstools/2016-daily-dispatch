Mqanduli Regional Court sentenced Siyamanga Msebe to life imprisonment after he was convicted for murder committed two years ago. According to evidence presented in court, on the night of August 16 2014, Msebe of Makhenkesi Township in Mqanduli, was with his friend when a fight broke up between his friend and the deceased, Sonwabile Gaba-Maqungwana.NPA spokesman Luxolo Tyali said Msebe got involved, taking his friend s side and the deceased subsequently ran away to his home.However, the killer, armed with a knife, threatened a friend of the deceased who was present during the fight to go show him the home of his would-be victim.&#8221;At the home of the deceased he knocked on the door and the unsuspecting mother of the deceased, who was sleeping in the same room as her son, instructed him to open the door. Upon opening the door, the deceased was stabbed numerous times and died on the scene,&#8221; said Tyali.During trial, Msebe pleaded not guilty denying everything put to him, but evidence from the witnesses called by state prosecutor Melikhaya Dyakopu, including the deceased s mother and the deceased s friend, convinced the court that he was guilty as charged.&#8221;The state prayed for the convicted murderer to be sentenced to life imprisonment as the callous offence was committed in front of the deceased s mother who was left traumatised, and the killer did not show remorse,&#8221; he said..The court agreed with the state and sentenced him accordingly.The NPA welcomes the sentence with the hope that it will serve as a deterrent to like-minded murderers.*Meanwhile, two men aged 20 and 35 were arrested by Ngqamakhwe police in connection with the murder of a 45-year-old woman they allegedly accused of practising witchcraft.Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said the deceased, Nozinzile Mtembe was stabbed to death on Monday at about 7pm at Sihlabeni village, Mtebhele administrative area near Ngqamakhwe.&#8221;The deceased suffered upper body injuries.The deceased, who was identified as Nozinzile Ntembe aged 45, who the two suspects allegedly accused of practising witchcraft,&#8221; said Manatha.Both suspects appeared before the Ngqamakhwe Magistrate s Court today for murder.
