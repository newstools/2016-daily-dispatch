A jilted mistress dumped by a prominent Eastern Cape businessman has caused a social media storm with an advert in the Daily Dispatch thanking him for giving her a daughter. The advert in the classified section of the newspaper featured a photograph of Mthatha businessman Phumelele Balfour, alongside a photograph of a two-year-old girl purported to be his love child with local businesswoman Nandipha Bhali.A social media storm has erupted since the advert placed by Bhali appeared on November 11.Supporters of the businessman, including a member of his family, attacked Bhali on social media, accusing her of trying to break up his marriage.Bhali s supporters have in turn called on the businessman to take responsibility for his love child.Contacted for comment yesterday, Balfour replied: I am utterly disappointed with the advert. The married businessman lives in an East London suburb with his family.He owns the Ultracity Shell garage on the N2, at the entrance to Mthatha.Bhali, a Beacon Bay-based businesswoman, last year founded a consulting company.In the advert, Bhali writes to Balfour reminding him that it was his one and only daughter s second birthday and goes on to state that Balfour personally named the child.Asked for comment yesterday, Bhali said if Balfour was offended by the advert he should take it up with the courts.Balfour also referred further queries to his attorney.The Dispatch understands the businessman has now hired a top East London private investigator to assist him in finding out who was behind death threats made to his wife.It is not yet clear if the threats are in any way connected with the advert.On Sunday, a Bhisho legislature employee posted a picture of the advert on Facebook and it soon generated more than 2000 comments. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
