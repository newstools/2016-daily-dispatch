The Buffalo City Metro revenue department has extended its operating hours to include Saturdays, when the office will remain open until 1.30pm for November. This is part of several initiatives that the municipality will employ to improve and address the backlog of billing queries.Mayor s office spokesman Ayabulela Ngogo said the initiative was part of the mayor s 100-days plan to improve services in the metro. When the new mayor took office we had highlighted the importance of making sure that we deliver efficient and convenient services to all our clients. These new office hours will also allow us to catch up with the backlog of cases that the municipality has received over time, said Ngogo.In September more than 200 residents marched to the city hall and delivered a memorandum to councillor Nontsikelelo Peter.In the memo the residents expressed their discontent with the billing process.Residents accused the municipality of failing to read meters and thumb-sucking interim charges, which sent usage bills rocketing.The Saturday opening will take place at the King William s Town civic centre, Munifin Centre in East London and Mdantsane City Mall until November 26.BCM Ratepayers Association Chairman Rudy du Toit said they welcomed the initiative, but it would be a waste of time if it wasn t efficient . This is definitely a good move on their part and I believe that it will alleviate the pressure of the cases that have been sitting with the municipality to a certain degree. The metro said it would use the month of November to pilot the new working hours with hopes of introducing them full time in 2017. We just want to see how the public responds to the call and then we will look at rolling out options, said Ngogo. simthandilef@dispatch.co.za
