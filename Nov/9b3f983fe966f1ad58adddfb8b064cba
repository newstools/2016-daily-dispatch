One was not home when the incident occurred.Trapped, with nowhere to go and hope running out, they heard a loud bang from the back door.Mulaishi who had heard their cries broke through the steel security door and saved everyone.Buffalo City Metro firefighters arrived to extinguish the blaze.Mulaishi s father, Pastor Paul Mulaishi, said he had heard the couple arguing earlier in the day.He was very proud of his heroic son, and said if it was not for him the occupants of the house could have died. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
