Afro-soul singer Dumza Maswana honoured his Grade 1 teacher at his album launch in East London on the weekend. His former teacher, Phumla Gongxeka, travelled all the way from Peddie to celebrate with Dumza at the album launch show.The Peddie-born singer, who is now based in Johannesburg, was in East London for his performance at the Guild Theatre.During his show, Maswana made special mention of Gongxeka for her contribution as a teacher and mother. She is not just a teacher, but she is one of the pillars of our community. She is respected in the community and it is because of such qualities that I decided to honour her on my show, he said.Maswana arranged for Gongxeka s son to fetch her at her Peddie home to be a part of the Molo album launch. Some people never get involved in the communities, they just teach kids and it ends there. I am disappointed that after serving our community for so many years she was never honoured for her great work. No farewell ceremony. I wish one day I could have the means to show her how much we appreciate her, he said.Maswana s attempts to make Gongxeka smile did not go unnoticed.Speaking to the Daily Dispatch, the 65-year-old former teacher said she was proud of the man Maswana had become. As a mother and teacher it always brings joy in your heart when you see your children doing things that they love and enjoy. Dumisani was born for what he is doing and I feel there is more on the way for him, she said.Gongxeka said if their school had all the necessary facilities for people with Maswana s talents, he would have been discovered a long time ago. Although he was not in the school choir, you would always find him singing and he was a smart pupil. I am really honoured that he would think of his Grade 1 teacher when launching his album, she said. poliswap@dispatch.co.za
