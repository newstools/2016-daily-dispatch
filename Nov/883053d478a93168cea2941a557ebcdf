The killers of South African architect and sailor Rob Meek have been sentenced to jail terms of between 22 and 24 years for the 2013 New Year s Eve murder in Port St Johns. Meek, who was holidaying on the Wild Coast from Cape Town, was gunned down in front of his family while celebrating the New Year.Judge Robert Griffiths from the Mthatha High Court, sitting in Port St Johns, on Wednesday sentenced four youths Siyavuya Madikizela, 21; Sifiso Mnyandu, 23; Jongile Mcologwane, 24; and Nceba Zobhula, 23 to jail after they were convicted on charges of murder, attempted robbery, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition.Madikizela, who pulled the trigger of the home-made firearm that killed Meek, was sentenced to 24 years for murder, while Mnyandu, Mcologwane and Zobhula were each sentenced to 22 years for the same charge, four years suspended for five years.All were sentenced to 10 years for attempted robbery and two years for possession of a firearm and ammunition.Griffiths ordered that the sentences run concurrently with the sentence for murder, which means Madikizela will effectively serve 20 years while the rest will serve 18 years.Meek s family were present during sentencing.According to evidence presented in court, Meek and his family were celebrating New Year s Eve in a self-catering guesthouse on December 31, 2013.Meek was with his wife, Di, his daughters Louise and Claudia, his mother-in-law Jean Almon and nine close friends.Armed with a home-made firearm, the four men accosted the family and pointed a firearm at them while threatening to assault them with dangerous weapons.They instructed the family to lie down and demanded money. In the process the shot that killed Meek was fired.The men fled the scene without taking anything.Meek s daughters and doctors tried for two hours to resuscitate him at a nearby hospital but he had lost a lot of blood by the time he arrived at the facility.Meek was a top architect and the brain behind Cape Town s V&amp;A Waterfront.He was a founding member of GAPP Architects and Urban Designers and also a member of the Royal Cape Yacht Club and trustee of the South African Ocean Racing Trust.Meek had just posed for a photograph with family and friends before he was shot.During the trial, the four youths pleaded not guilty, claiming the home-made firearm was discharged by mistake.But senior state advocate Sibusiso Nolutshungu managed to convince the court they were guilty as charged.In sentencing them, the court took the men s youthfulness into account and the fact they had been in custody since their arrests in January 2014.The National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesman, Luxolo Tyali, welcomed the sentence. This will serve as deterrent to some would-be killers, especially those targeting tourists and denting the good reputation of some tourist destinations in our country, said Tyali.Port St Johns resident and businessman, John Costello, who knows the family well, spoke to them shortly after court adjourned. The impression I got was that although there are still some emotions, (Meek s) family are happy that justice has finally been served, said Costello. They are pleased that eventually, after the case was delayed, it has come to finality and now they will have closure. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
