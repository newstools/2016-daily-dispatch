Residents from Buffalo City Metro s ward 18 have complained that the unsecured James Pearce Park in Stirling is fast becoming a drug haven after the metro failed to secure the place for a decade. Despite being listed as a priority project in the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) since 2006, the failure to make the family park safe has sparked new concerns from residents.DA councillor Isabel Thompson, who was a ward councillor in the area for 10 years, has demanded answers from acting city manager Nceba Ncunyana. She wants a time frame which will to get the languishing project going again.In a motion tabled before council recently, Thompson said that from 2006 to 2011 council had called the fencing and lockable gate project a priority and it went onto the IDP in 2011 where it has been sitting since.She probed: Why has the fencing and lockable gate in James Pearce Park, which has been on the IDP for 10 years, not been implemented? The fencing and lockable gate remains a priority for ward 18 for 2016-2021. The park is used for training dogs, a tennis club, a playground for children and is a wedding photograph venue.Vagrants have also turned a vacant municipal building into their home.Thompson told the Daily Dispatch yesterday that the lack of security in the park had attracted party animals who played loud music and other people who now used the park to have wild sex .She said: We always see used condoms in the mornings in that park. Even during the day people go there to have sex, said Thompson.She was tired of being told of budget constraints when money budgeted to fix the park was diverted to other projects.However, BCM spokesman Sibusiso Cindi denied that there was ever any funding for fencing of the park previously.He said in the current financial year a total budget of R500000 has been allocated for fencing of community parks, which includes fencing of the James Pearce Park in Stirling. The Municipal Services Department is, however, awaiting the annual contract for palisade fencing to be finalized, Cindi said.Ncunyana is expected to provide answers to the raised questions in council next week.New ward 18 councillor David Viaene said many parents took their children to the park with its litter of condoms and lack of security. mamelag@dispatch.co.za
