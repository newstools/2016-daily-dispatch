Just five days after King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo s son Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo was identified by one faction of AmaDlomo royal family as acting king, he opened the gates of Bumbane Great Place after being granted an interim order by the Mthatha High Court. The place had been left vacant and in a state of neglect after Dalindyebo and his family vacated it just a few days before his arrest.Armed with a court order, Azenathi and members of the AmaDlomo royal family went to open the gates of the great place in the company of the sheriff of the high court Ntuso Majokweni and employees of a local locksmith.The padlocks to the main gate were cut open by Majokweni in the presence of Azenathi and Chief Dumisani Mgudlwa.In the urgent application, Azenathi who was the applicant, cited Buyiswa Mbondi (Queen Nokwanda Dalindyebo) and his father Buyelekhaya as respondents.Azenathi said he had personally talked to Queen Nokwanda requesting the great place to be opened after he found it in state of despair. But unfortunately, she would not agree to open the great place or hand over the keys. Opening the Bumbane Great Place is not for my personal benefit but everybody who has a right to access the great place, said Azenathi.Judge Richard Brooks said the respondents (Nokwanda and King Buyelekhaya) must show cause on November 22 why the order should not be made final. The first respondent is hereby ordered to forthwith grant access or hand over the keys to Bumbane Great Place to the applicant or any other person acting in his stead, Brooks said in the event Nokwanda refused to hand over the keys or grant access to Azenathi, the sheriff of the high court was authorised to use the services of a locksmith. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
