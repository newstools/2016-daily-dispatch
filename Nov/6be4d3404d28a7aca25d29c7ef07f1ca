The family of the renowned Cape Town architect and urban designer Rob Meek has now found closure after the Mthatha High Court sentenced his killers to lengthy jail term s for the 2013 New Year&#8217;s Port St Johns murder. The killers have been sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from 22 and 24 years. The Cape Town holidaymaker was gunned down in the full view of his family in Port St Johns just minutes after popping champagne to welcome in the New Year. At the Mthatha High Court sitting in Port St Johns, Judge Robert Griffiths on Wednesday, sentenced Siyavuya Madikizela, 21; Sifiso Mnyandu, 23; Jongile Mcologwane, 24 , and Nceba Zobhula, 23 who were convicted on charges of murder, attempted robbery, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition. Madikizela, who pulled the trigger of the home-made firearm that killed Meek, was sentenced to 24 years for murder. Mnyandu, Mcologwane and Zobhula were each sentenced to 22 years for the same charge, four years of which were suspended for five years. The NPA regional spokesman Luxolo Tyali welcomed the sentence. This will serve as a deterrent to would-be killers, especially those targeting tourists and denting the good reputation of some tourist destinations in our country, said Tyali.
