Help was close at hand for a preschool that was vandalised during a burglary last week. Isisekho Preschool in Mdantsane, which caters for 54 little ones, was trashed when thugs broke in last Monday.Forklift driver Bulelani Fowl, 32 who retired in 2011 to start up an NGO called Community Independent Consciousness (CIC) said when he heard about the break-in, he went with his partner to take a look.They were horrified. Doors and sinks were missing. Windows were smashed and water gushed from damaged pipes.Fowl felt strongly that he needed to help the school immediately. He approached Mdantsane Build-It and the company donated three doors, a burglar gate, sinks and wooden planks to build shelves.Next, Fowl approached the Mdantsane Spar, where he was given mielie meal, samp and sugar for the children. We felt that while the matter was still being investigated CIC had to help out. Having done other community upliftment projects I knew it would not take me long to get help. The school was broken into on Monday and we handed over these donations the same week. The NGO also bought school uniforms, clothing for needy parents and new toys for the pupils. The goods were all handed over at a formal ceremony last Friday.Principal Priscilla Mbekwa said the school got broken into almost every month but this time was by far the worst in terms of damage.The constant burglaries were so stressful for the little preschool community that some parents had even stopped bringing their children.She thanked CIC and each of the donors with all her heart. Our school had lost almost everything but hope has been restored, she said.Fowl said anyone wanting to support CIC or the school could contact him on 071-946-2018/ 063-052-4282 or e-mail him at
