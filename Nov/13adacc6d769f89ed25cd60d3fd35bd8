While privately owned dairies and shops selling unpasteurised and fermented milk in Buffalo City Metro have been closed down, a government funded cooperative of emerging farmers in Keiskammahoek continues to trade. Seven Stars Dairy Trust, a scheme funded by the Eastern Cape department of agriculture, sells 30 000 litres of raw milk to the public, hawkers, local businesses and schools daily.The scheme consists of 35 black farmers all shareholders and has more than 3000 dairy cattle with 2 000 of those currently producing between 25 000 to 30 000 litres of milk every day.Chairwoman Lumka Maso, 67, confirmed to the Daily Dispatch that the trust, which started operating under the Ciskei regime, doesn t pasteurise the milk. We have recently acquired machinery sponsored by the department of agriculture which will help us start the pasteurisation process. Maso said the trust had sent two students on training to Coega Dairy as part of its skills development programme to learn about pasteurisation. Our milk is tested regularly for quality and health standards by government health practitioners. The scheme, which died along with the Ciskei regime, was resuscitated by Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti during his tenure as Eastern Cape agriculture MEC.The shutting of farms and dairies selling unpasteurised milk came in the wake of a foodborne illness outbreak in Buffalo City Metro and Amathole District municipality.Last month, about 1056 pupils from 12 schools were rushed to three provincial hospitals after drinking contaminated fermented milk that came from a King William s Town dairy shop. Five dairy farms and four shops have been closed so far by the BCM for selling unpasteurised milk.The sale of raw milk is in contravention of the law.Banana Valley Farming Trust on the N6 was identified as the source of the contaminated milk found at Innesfree in King William s Town.The farm will receive a compliance letter to shut down today, owner Robert Hayes confirmed.Maso said most of the Seven Stars Dairy Trust s milk went to the Coega Dairy in Port Elizabeth, the makers of Coastal View milk and butter.The Daily Dispatch sent questions to MEC of rural development and agrarian reform Mlibo Qoboshiyane who was unable to respond at the time of going to print.ADM spokesman Siyabulela Makunga was unable to say why dairies producing raw milk in ADM were still operating while those in BCM were being closed. malibongwed@dispatch.com
