Eyes filled with tears when an eight-year-old double amputee pulled on new high-tech prosthetic Spiderman legs, ran up to a soccer ball and scored five goals. The little boy was Ubuko Mpotulo, who lost his legs and several fingers when he was two years old.The goalie was Paralympic gold medallist Ernst van Dyk, who was born with no legs and was also wearing prosthetic limbs.Van Dyk, 43, was a special guest at the handover of two sets of Ubuko s new legs at the East London Health Resource Centre yesterday.The news limbs one pair fitted with a knee for everyday wear and another sporting blades for running and playing will replace a pair of old-fashioned prosthetic legs that have no feet or movable parts. The old ones made a noise when I walked and they were not comfortable, said Ubuko. My new legs fit nicely and I love the ones with Spiderman because he is my favourite hero and they are very nice for playing soccer, he said, adding he wants to be a doctor and soccer player when he grows up. I want to help someone, he said.Frere Hospital CEO Dr Rolene Wagner said Ubuko s legs were amputated after he contracted meningococcal septacaemia, which destroyed his blood vessels and led to gangrene.Wagner hailed Ubuko s Grade 1 College Street Primary teacher Janey Stevens who ignited the initiative to help him by making a video of him running energetically around the school field with other children on short leather stumps and sending it to people she thought could help. When I saw the video I watched it as a mom of a disabled daughter and I saw in him what I saw in my Laura, said Wagner, who ensured the little boy received help from Frere health professionals to use his new limbs.Also cheering the plucky little boy on was prosthetist Marissa Nel who built the legs for Ubuko, which will have to have new sockets and adjustments 14 times as he grows.Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle, who gave Ubuko a medal of courage said seeing him play soccer and overcome his disability was what heroes are made of .The boy s emotional mother Nokuthula Mpotulo said she was grateful to everyone who helped. When we heard about it, we jumped to help, said marketing general manager Nomfundo Mcilongo of RMA, the project s main funder.Van Dyk said: We take small steps today but they are big steps for a little man. barbarah@dispatch.co.za
