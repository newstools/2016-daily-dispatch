Multitalented radio personality and actor Monde Kapa has joined Algoa FM as a producer and presenter. Kapa joined the Eastern Cape-based station at the beginning of this month. He is the new producer for the Jeff Moloi Show, which airs on weekdays from 7pm. He is also the new presenter of a Saturday night music show.Kapa, who has been at Algoa FM in Port Elizabeth for about two weeks now, said the place has already become his second home. Everyone here is so nice and approachable that you sometimes think you are on another planet. I ve lived in big cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg and those concrete jungles are real. He has worked for stations such as 5FM, Good Hope, KFM and Highveld. Many may know him for his lead role on the Sinutab big head commercial and also as Vuyo s friend in the Hansa Pilsner advert. He was also a prime time anchor on e.tv.Kapa said his primary job was to run the desk from their headquarters in Port Elizabeth every evening as Moloi broadcasts from Hemingways Mall in East London. It s a new and exciting challenge for me that needs to be executed down to the T. One needs a very good understanding of the broadcast desk but most importantly Mr Jeff and I have to get on like a house on fire as we still have a product to produce and present to thousands of people, he said. As someone who has been an on-air presenter for some years now, presenting is my first love and I always try to inject a special type of unique passion into my presentation style, accompanied with an understanding of what the Algoa FM listener is accustomed to, of course. While keeping to what the listeners are accustomed to, Kapa said you can t reinvent the radio wheel but you sure can pimp it up and put some 20-inch rims on it, nothing wrong with a little flair .Algoa FM s operations director Alfie Jay said it was the universe that delivered Kapa to their door.
