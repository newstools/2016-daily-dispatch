Nigerian prophet TB Joshua incorrectly predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the US presidential election. But as you might already know Clinton failed to win over America s majority at the voting polls. Now Twitter has gone searching for someone to blame for this and all fingers are pointing to Joshua. Two days before the election the self-styled prophet of the Synagogue of the Church Of All Nations took to Facebook to share his predictions.Someone pls get me TB Joshua&#39;s passport number pic.twitter.com/ErZoT1JPjC&mdash; Nanasei (@SirAmankwaah) November 9, 2016 Ten days ago I saw the new President of America with a narrow win.
