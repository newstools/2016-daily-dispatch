Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle has vowed to make Dimbaza more habitable for the physically disabled. Masualle paid a visit to Bongani Vumbela, a blind resident who was knocked down by a speeding car last weekend. Another blind resident, who was also struck by the car, died. The incident has not only disturbed the blind community of Dimbaza, it has also disturbed the entire community of the area and the government, Masualle said.The fatal accident came just a few weeks after the blind community from the area marched to a local police station to protest against the police s failure to arrest the driver of another car, which killed two other blind pedestrians in Dimbaza in August.Masualle said it was unfortunate that it took such an incident to highlight the need to create a habitable environment for the community. These incidents show complete ignorance of the drivers in that area. It means we have to strengthen our awareness campaigns in the area and make sure that there is visible signage in that area, Masualle said.Polar Park in Dimbaza has become home to more than 58 blind-headed households, who were first recruited in 1990 from across the former Bantustans with the aim of upskilling them for a better life.They joined the Enoch Sontonga Rehabilitation Centre in Dimbaza where they were joined by other physically disabled people and taught sewing.However, when the factories collapsed in the area, these residents became dependent on social grants and a few cooperatives that have since been established for them.The provincial manager of Disabled People South Africa, Mncedisi Nkota, said such incidents should be seen as indicators of how the community still needs to be made aware of people living with disabilities in Dimbaza.The premier also promised to get the provincial police commissioner involved in resolving the cases.
