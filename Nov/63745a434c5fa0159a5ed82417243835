A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake pummeled central New Zealand early on Monday, killing at least two people, damaging roads and buildings and setting off hundreds of strong aftershocks. Emergency response teams flew by helicopter to the region at the epicenter of the tremor, which struck just after midnight some 91 km (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch in the South Island, amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings.&#8220;It&#8217;s just utter devastation, I just don&#8217;t know &#8230; that&#8217;s months of work,&#8221; New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee after flying over the coastal town of Kaikoura, according to Brownlee&#8217;s Twitter account.Powerlines and telecommunications were down, with huge cracks in roads, land slips and other damage to infrastructure making it hard to reach the worst-affected areas.A tsunami warning that led to mass evacuations after the original quake was downgraded after large swells hit New Zealand&#8217;s capital Wellington , in the North Island, and Christchurch.Wellington was a virtual ghost town with workers ordered to stay away while the city council assessed the risk to buildings, several of which were damaged by the tremor. There were concerns that loose glass and masonry could be dislodged by severe weather hitting the capital, with 140 km per hour (85 mph) winds forecast.Hundreds of aftershocks, the strongest a 6.2 quake at about 1.45 p.m. local time (0045 GMT), rattled the South Pacific country, fraying nerves in an area where memories of a deadly 2011 quake are still fresh.Christchurch, the largest city on New Zealand&#8217;s ruggedly beautiful South Island, is still recovering from the 6.3 quake in 2011 that killed 185 people.New Zealand&#8217;s Civil Defence declared a state of emergency for the Kaikoura region, centered on a tourist town about 150 km (90 miles) northeast of Christchurch, soon after Monday&#8217;s large aftershock.Kaikoura, a popular spot for whale watching, appeared to have borne the brunt of the quake.&#8220;Our immediate priority is ensuring delivery of clean water, food and other essentials to the residents of Kaikoura and the estimated 1,000 tourists in the town,&#8221; Brownlee said.The Navy&#8217;s multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury was heading to the area, he said.Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) said a 20-person rescue team and two sniffer dogs had arrived in the town. A second team was on standby in Christchurch, USAR said in a statement.Police in the area around Christchurch reported 19 burglaries of homes and commercial properties after the quake as residents headed for higher ground.&#8220;It is extremely disappointing that at a time when people are facing such a traumatic event and communities are coming together to support one another, there are others who are only interested in taking advantage, Canterbury District Commander Superintendent John Price said in a statement.TWIN QUAKESHours after the quake, officials said a slip dam caused by the quakes that had blocked the Clarence River north of the town had breached, sending a wall of water downstream.A group of kayakers missing on the river was later reported safe.New Zealand&#8217;s Geonet measured Monday&#8217;s first quake at magnitude 7.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 7.8.
