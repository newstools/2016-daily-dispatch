Eastern Cape crafters have spent the last few months sewing and knitting exquisite Christmas decorations with a distinctive South African theme for an East London mall. Vincent Park shopping centre will soon be festooned with bright crochet and patchwork baubles, winged Shweshwe angels, giant fabric hearts and metres of African Prayer flag bunting in a bid to showcase and support local handcraft and fabric.General manager Joseph Parsley said the non-traditional festive decorations were commissioned via craft specialist Marika Jacobs to highlight the work of crafters and to give the mall a local flavour this holiday season.Jacobs was behind the successful Eastern Cape Handmade Collection pop-up shop which sold innovative locally-made handmade crafts at the centre last December. They will give the centre a nice original touch be cause there is a person behind each piece of handmade art, said Parsley.Vincent Park marketing manager, Mariaan Hartwig, said the idea was to bring the community into Christmas. We have so much talent in this area and it is important to support them. We upcycled some of the giant baubles we use every year by having them covered in crochet and knitting. Hartwig said about 50 whimsical African angels would be sold in aid of charity after Christmas.Craft specialist Jacobs said she had been approached by the centre to identify crafters and had subcontracted two groups of creative women in East London and the Skoda women s co-op in Queenstown. We used lively non-traditional Christmas colours like orange, lime green and cerise pink, so there will be a nice festive atmosphere. This is about spreading awareness that handmade quality products are out there and we should support them because they buy food for someone s family, said Jacobs.Crafter Zo Voyi said she and her partner Zandile Cakatiso, who both studied fashion at WSU before opening their own business called Visions Becoming, made 60 rope-and-Shweshwe African Angels of various complexions.They also made large stars and hearts which will be adorned with slogans such as Love Eastern Cape and Love Imonti .The decorations will be going up from Monday. barbarah@dispatch.co.za
