Serial paedophile Bruce Ehrlich, 54, who was sent back to jail on April 11 after the parole board found he had broken his parole conditions, is suing for his freedom. He was found to have played squash at an East London sports club with minor boys.Erhlich was in the Grahamstown High Court yesterday before Judge Murray Lowe arguing that he had six matters that underpinned his demand to get out of jail.He is also suing the Correctional Services Department for three claims of contempt of court.Correctional Services regional commissioner Nkosinathi Breakfast yesterday told the Dispatch: We are back in court again [today] defending the case.We are confident that the matter will be in our favour. Four matters are set to be heard today, two less than the six Ehrlich brought against the parole board claiming all were urgent. Lowe ruled that two were not urgent and scheduled them for November 24.Ehrlich complained about inadequate winter clothing, poor prison food, and a change in his group classification from B to C, which meant he no longer qualified for visitors.Ehrlich was sent back to prison after a parole board investigation found he was playing squash with and coaching young boys at the Cambridge sports club. One of the parole conditions of the former karate teacher was that he must never teach minors.If his bid to challenge the board s ruling to send him back to prison fails, the now-successful businessman, who founded and manages East London s KwikPave, may well have to serve out his 15-year jail sentence, which means he may be in prison until 2018.According to court papers, in 2003 the East London Regional Court sentenced Ehrlich to 15 years imprisonment after convicting him of 14 counts of indecent assault of minor boys.He had been convicted of similar offences in Knysna in the early 1990s.In 2010, despite being dubbed in his various trials by expert witnesses as both a regressive and fixated paedophile, he was released on parole having served just seven years of his 15-year sentence.One of the conditions of his parole was that he was not allowed to leave the East London magisterial district.However, he said in court papers that he had left East London in April for a few weeks to attend to his growing franchise in Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.The department is represented by Advocate Matthew Mphahlwa. Ehrlich is representing himself. The matter continues today. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
