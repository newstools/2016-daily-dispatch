Eastern Cape residents will have to wait a few more years before the ambitious R12.5-billion Umzimvubu dam becomes reality. Water Affairs first announced plans to build the dam in 2012, at an estimated cost of R470-million.But at the launch of the project in April 2014, President Jacob Zuma announced that the project would cost more than R12.5-billion.However, two years on, the project has yet to get off the ground. In fact, not one of the more than 6000 jobs Zuma promised the project would create has been created, Water Affairs spokesman Mlimandlela Ndamase announced this week.Zuma conducted the sod-turning ceremony for the Mzimvubu Catchments Project in Tsolo, a month before the May 2014 general elections.At the time the Dispatch reported the president committing the project to a start time of six months later (November 2014).However, two years later, the Water Affairs and Sanitation Department headed by Minister Nomvula Mokonyane is still busy with project designs and not a single job has been created.Ndamase said they were still busy with designs and once the designs were finalised they would be packaged for approval and commencement of construction .The project includes the construction of two multi-purpose dams Ntabelanga and Laleni along the Tsitsa river a tributary of the Mzimvubu.The dam would become the 10th largest in the country and store about 490 million cubic metres of water.The Laleni dam would be used to generate 35 megawatts of base hydroelectric power, getting up to 180MW at its peak when operated jointly with the Ntabelanga dam.Zuma announced at the time that the construction of the Ntabelanga dam would begin in November 2014 for completion by February 2018, while work on the Laleni hydroelectricity power scheme would start in the 2016-17 financial year.But Ndamase admitted this week the project had been delayed and some elements of construction work would only start in early 2017, with dam construction and hydroelectric power developments to potentially begin six months after. There are two dams being considered and the Ntabelanga dam should be completed in 2020 with Laleni dam targeted for 2022. By 2024 bulk water distribution infrastructure should be completed to supply communities with water, added Ndamase.The project will supply clean water to 720000 households in communities around OR Tambo, Alfred Nzo and Joe Gqabi district municipalities and other parts of the province.Zuma announced at the time that the project would create about 6700 jobs a year during construction and 6500 jobs a year when in operation.But Ndamase admitted yesterday that no jobs have been created at this stage as no work has commenced and only professional services and studies are currently under way. He said R32-million had been spent on preliminary and professional duties such as designs, studies, and land acquisitions work, and R129-million more has been set aside for the 2016-17 financial year.A progress report on the project was tabled at the September Eastern Cape cabinet lekgotla, where it was announced the environmental assessment had been approved. zineg@dispatch.co.za
