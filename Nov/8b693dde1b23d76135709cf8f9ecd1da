A major upgrade to a multimillion-rand wastewater treatment plant outside Zwelitsha came to a halt yesterday after 200 angry residents from Ward 25 blocked the site. They set up a barricade of burning tyres and accused councillors of interfering in the hiring of labourers to work on the project.The crowd accused Ward 25 councillor Mthetheleli Crosby Kolela of trying to get rid of people hired through the previous councillor s project steering committee and replacing them with people of his choice.Kolela dismissed the claims as tricks by his political opponents who lost out to him in the local government elections.Community leader Sipho Gladini, 63, alleged that Kolela, who had been a ward councillor from 1994 to 1999 and again in 2009 to 2011, had destroyed many projects by squandering funds during this time. When the previous councillor, Cynthia Gakrishe, took over from him after the 2011 elections, she had a huge task of cleaning Kolela s mess by unblocking many projects including this one and she hired poor community members .The residents accused Kolela of playing divide-and-rule politics within the steering committee and creating factions.Members of the crowd also claimed they never voted for Kolela during an ANC branch general meeting ahead of the August 3 elections and that he was imposed on them by the party bosses.On completion, the R250-million project will service large parts of King William s Town, Bhisho, Phakamisa, Breidbach, Ndevana and Schornville.Gladini said a group of 60 people who had passed medical tests were set to start work on Monday but Kolela ordered all those hired under Gakrishe to take a back seat.He said a group of 40 people who got work when the project started in February had to undergo another set of medical and fitness tests by Kolele and this had not happened, and they were not working.Gladini claimed the first 40 work-seekers passed their tests and got work from the steering committee led by Gakrishe.Kolela yesterday dismissed all the allegations as just tricks by his political enemies to frustrate him. These are the people who lost against me during party processes and are now trying to fight me through projects, Kolela said.He said he launched an investigation into the project after some communities complained that Gakrishe s steering committee hired people from one of four different communities in the ward.Kolela said he was ensuring geographical representivity in giving out jobs.He said he disbanded the steering committee amid mounting calls from the community to sack them.Buffalo City Metro spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said yesterday: The community is protesting about the way and manner in which the people were employed in the Zwelitsha Water Treatment Plant project. They are also complaining that the project steering committee is not responding to the community, but to the previous councillor. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
