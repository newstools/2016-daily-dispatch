Jailed AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo s eldest son Prince Azenathi Zanelizwe Dalindyebo has been appointed acting king of the AbaThembu again. A ceremony to install him in the position is scheduled for November 25.However, due to feuding factions in the royal family, Azenathi s ascension to the throne means the AbaThembu now have two acting kings, as his uncle Prince Mankunku Mthandeni Jongisizwe Dalindyebo, 47, was also appointed to the acting position.Azenathi, 24, was appointed acting king during an AbaThembu national meeting held at Bumbane Great Place near Mthatha on Sunday while Mankunku was appointed on October 21 by his supporters during a meeting of Ngangelizwe royal houses.Neither side recognises the other s acting king, although Azenathi has received the blessing of the AbaThembu s national executive committee (NEC), including AbaThembu from KwaZulu-Natal and other provinces.NEC chairman Vusi Mvelase and members of the executive travelled from KZN to Bumbane Great Place to support Azenathi.Chief Thandisizwe Mtirara, the chairman of the AbaThembu royal family faction that is supporting the young acting king, said Sunday s meeting was to confirm a resolution taken last year on October 25 to appoint Azenathi. His father and royal family members took the resolution. It was later confirmed by all AmaDlomo, traditional leaders and [the] AbaThembu nation as whole, said Mtirara.Chief Dumisani Mgudwa stressed that Azenathi would be installed only as acting king.Azenathi s uncle, Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo said: We have taken the decision that on November 25 he will be installed. Speakers at Sunday s event lashed out at the rival family faction. Mvelase, and Mdengentonga Liwani, who is the leader of the #FreeOurKingCampaign to have Dalindyebo released from prison, were particularly critical of the rival grouping.Liwani said the royal family spent more time fighting over the acting kingship than in the fight to have Dalindyebo released from prison. Azenathi was the rightful person to act in the position, he added.Addressing the media, Azenathi said he was ready to lead the AbaThembu in the absence of his father. Azenathi said the journey to this point had been long, winding and bumpy. My father and the AmaDlomo has more than four times introduced me to the core royal family, AmaDlomo as a whole, the nation of AbaThembu and other forums, that if something happens to him, I his son will lead the AbaThembu nation, said Azenathi.He offered an olive branch to Mankunku and spoke of unity in the family.He said his uncle was being used by people who have hidden agendas for their own personal gains. They rejoice over the disunity of the royal family while us on the other hand are praying day and night for unity, said Azenathi. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
