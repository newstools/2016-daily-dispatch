The new Eastern Cape head of the national municipal guild has made a call for unity in Eastern Cape local governments. Mxolisi Koyo, who is the council speaker in the Chris Hani district municipality, was elected provincial executive chairman without opposition at the two-day South African Local Government Association (Salga) conference that ended yesterday in East London.His call for unity was in response to violent incidents that broke out during council meetings in both Buffalo City Metro and Nelson Mandela Bay last week.Koyo took over the reins from OR Tambo executive mayor Nomakhosazana Meth, who has served on the committee for the past five years.Speaking to the Daily Dispatch yesterday Koyo said for the next five years the new committee would assist in building better municipalities by entrenching professionalism and deepening democracy while working closely with communities. We will be working towards servicing the public as municipalities are responsible for delivering basic services, said Koyo. We want to fight against the infighting and account for public funds.
