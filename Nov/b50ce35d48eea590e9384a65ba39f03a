The ANC s Chris Hani regional leaders want Phumulo Masualle to serve a third term as provincial chairman. This is one of the resolutions the regional executive committee (REC) made at a meeting held last week.Regional secretary Lusanda Sizani confirmed yesterday that the decision to retain the status quo was made when the REC was crafting a road map towards the ANC national elective conference in 2017.The provincial conference is likely to be held early next year.The ruling party has a busy schedule next year as it will hold its national general council where delegates brainstorm on policy matters and its elective conference where President Jacob Zuma s successor is chosen.The Eastern Cape has the added responsibility of electing its provincial executive committee next year.Sizani said considering all of the above we discussed the importance of reviving our branches by ensuring those who have arrears for the ANC memberships ensure that they pay, and that we have 500 members in each of our 110 branches. It was in that context that we resolved that as Chris Hani region we are going to call for unity. In fact, we said we are going to lobby for non-contestation for positions so that we maintain unity within our province. We are saying it is important that we retain this leadership, which has managed to bring stability within our movement dating back to the Riverpark conference, added Sizani.He was referring to the watershed elective provincial conference in September 2009 which saw Masualle win the provincial chairman position against the now Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas.It was at the same conference that Oscar Mabuyane was elected as provincial secretary. Both Masualle and Mabuyane were elected to serve a second term in June 2013.The Dispatch reported earlier this year that Mabuyane was being touted to replace Masualle as provincial chairman, but Sizani said the Chris Hani REC believes that any contestation will not be healthy for our unity. This is the position of the REC, but branches will have to express themselves first so that we can, as a region, speak with one voice, added Sizani.If the Chris Hani REC s wishes are realised, it would mean that deputy chairman Sakhumzi Somyo, provincial treasurer Thandiswa Marawu as well as deputy secretary Hellen Sauls-August will likely retain their current positions. zineg@dispatch.co.za
