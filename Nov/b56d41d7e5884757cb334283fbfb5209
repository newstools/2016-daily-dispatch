Buffalo City s assets worth millions are at risk without the security guards it needs. This was revealed in a council report presented by acting metro manager Nceba Ncunyana after a request by the council for a comprehensive report on the security situation amid fears of a number of councillors for their lives. While he updated council on the critical shortage of security guards in BCM, Ncunyana s report failed to answer questions raised on the overall security status of the institution.BCM has 386 security guards in the department of public safety and law enforcement services. The metro s organogram approves 586 guards.But Ncunyana said another 200 was still not enough, and it would take another 301 guards to fully secure the metro s assets around the clock.
