National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams says media reports that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would be charged before Christmas were entirely without merit as far as they related to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Although charging an accused person is the prerogative of the police a decision in respect of this matter will only be made once the investigation has been concluded Abrahams said in a statement on Monday.He said it was not in the interest of the country for the matter to be investigated in perpetuity.That is why he had called on the parties involved to accelerate the investigation in order to bring finality to the matter Abrahams said. Any speculation in respect of the matter is undesirable as it will cause unnecessary uncertainty and contribute to instability. The reports were sparked by an article in City Press on Sunday which said a number of Hawks detectives were regulars in Abrahams office so much so that they had been given access cards and were no longer required to sign the visitors register. The so-called senior executive from NPA quoted by the paper is dishonest to say the least as he/she is not involved in the matter. The National Director does not meet with detectives hence the article is completely disingenuous.
