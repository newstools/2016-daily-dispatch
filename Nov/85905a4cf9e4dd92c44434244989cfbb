A Rhodes University student accused of orchestrating the brutal torture and murder of a Grahamstown man he suspected of stealing his laptop will have to wait until Thursday to hear if he will get bail. Magistrate Lindelwa Figlan told third-year anthropology and Xhosa student Thembani Onceya she was not ready to make a ruling.During Onceya&#8217;s bail application, which was held over several days, horrific details emerged of the abuse Thembelani Qwakanisa endured before he finally died.While state prosecutor Lyle Prins argued that Onceya was a key player in the torture and murder &#8212; which included breaking fingers, pulling teeth with pliers and pouring hot water down Qwakanisa&#8217;s throat &#8212; defence attorney Basil Williams said his client was not even there when it happened.Williams said the well-known local poet and social activist was in his university residence at the time while Prins said they had statements from Onceya&#8217;s 76-year-old grandmother saying he was there when Qwakanisa died.
