A University of Fort Hare lecturer could be in hot water if allegations of racism levelled against him turn out to be true. Business management finalstudents at UFH s East London campus have written to their head of department asking that lecturer Ben Jordaan be replaced with another lecturer.UFH communications director Khotso Moabi said the HoD had called the students to a meeting to establish the facts and find solutions .Speaking of a previous case against Jordaan, Moabi said: Jordaan last year was fired by the university due to claims of racism, however the students that were supposed to testify against Mr Jordaan did not pitch to testify against the lecturer. The case was then subsequently dropped against Mr Jordaan, said Moabi.The university would not provide Jordaan s contact details for comment.Last year, Jordaan was accused of giving students excessively tough questions so they would fail. As a result, he was fired from his job.However, the Commission for Conciliation, Arbitration and Mediation (CCMA) ruled he be reinstated and that the university pay him R360 000.In their latest letter, the students complain that Jordaan refused to help them rewrite a test in which they performed dismally this year.One student said they were not equipped for the upcoming exams . simthandilef @dispatch.co.za
