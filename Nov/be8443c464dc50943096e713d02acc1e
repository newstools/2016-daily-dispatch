Buffalo City Metro executive mayor Xola Pakati launched a multi-million rand bus and taxi rank project in King William s Town (KWT) this week. Addressing commuters at the launch on Thursday, he said actual construction of the R81.4-million project was scheduled to start next week, weather permitting.The project will see 16 new buildings that will house a taxi and bus repair workshop, vehicle wash facility, toilets for the public, two food courts and hawker trading facilities.Pakati said KWT residents highlighted the need to have a new taxi rank during mayoral imbizos in the area. We are here today to confirm that we have heeded your call and we have kept our word and you will have the rank you so much needed, Pakati said.Acting engineering services head, Luyanda Mbula, said taxi and bus canopies would also be built to protect passengers. The contractor is expected to complete the project in 30 calendar months, though the contract s stipulated time-frame is 36 months, Mbula said.The project will be divided into three phases.Phase one will see the demolition of four existing buildings at the existing market square taxi and bus rank. Other phase one projects include:Construction of eight new building structures;Mbula said phase two would include the demolition of three more buildings, construction of eight new ones as well as improvement of perimeter lighting and fencing.The final phase will see the construction of a new pedestrian link to Mary Street.Also present at the launch was the mayoral committee head for engineering services, Ncedo Kumbaca.Kumbaca said the new taxi rank would go a long way towards helping commuters battling to find transport because there were several small taxi ranks operating in the KWT central business district. Not only will 60 job opportunities be created but the entire BCM inland will benefit, said Kumbaca.Pakati said the ranks, which were operating separately, had resulted in deadly taxi violence in the past. We are hopeful now that there is one main rank to accommodate everyone. This will bring to an end those rival fights, he said. zineg@dispatch.co.za
