An East London indigent resident got the shock of his life when he was slapped with a R2.1-million Buffalo City Metro municipal bill. Xolani Dezide, 45, of Mdantsane s NU11, now fears that he might lose the RDP house he and his two brothers have called home for 38 years as he cannot afford the shocking bill.Dezide is one of thousands of angry residents who have been complaining of the BCM billing system.Dezide, a security guard, told the Daily Dispatch at the weekend that when he tried to enquire about the bill, he was sent from pillar to post by officials at the NU6 and CBD municipal offices. I don t know how they got to this huge figure because we don t even have a geyser. We use electricity for lighting and cooking only. I fear we might be kicked out of the house because we cannot pay this debt. In the eight years that I have worked as a security guard, I have not earned anywhere close to this R2-million the municipality says we owe. In September, hundreds of residents marched to the East London City Hall demanding the metro fix its billing system and incorrect water readings. The city was also accused of thumb-sucking residents bills.BCM spokesman Sibusiso Cindi acknowledged there were challenges with the metro s billing system.He said every Saturday from October 22 to November 26, the metro has and will be working to rectify incorrect bills at all revenue offices.These extended opening hours, from 8.30am to 1.30pm, are for the offices in the CBD, Mdantsane City and King William s Town. The BCM revenue department is currently running a campaign where it calls upon every resident whose house bill is incorrect to come forth. We would therefore like to encourage the Mdantsane resident Xolani Dezide to visit our offices and get his bill sorted, Cindi said.Even though he has been trying to sort the bill debacle since September when he received it, the father of three is hopeful the matter will soon be sorted. ndamasem@dispatch.co.za
