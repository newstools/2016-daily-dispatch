It takes about three minutes to drive past the normally sleepy town of Berlin situated between East London and King William s Town. But on Saturday the town will burst into life when the annual Berlin November traditional horse-racing handicap takes centre-stage just 3km from the CBD.Event organisers confirmed yesterday that they were 80% ready to welcome people from across the country.In addition to the horse race, fashion, music and arts will make up the festivities expected on the day.Event founder Luthando Bara was ecstatic yesterday, declaring it the biggest traditional horse-racing gathering in SA. He promised to go bigger than ever before and, if the marquees that have been put up in the village are anything to go by, it promises to be an extravaganza of note.One of the marquees will host a fashion show coordinated by Busisiwe Nodada, where 40 local designers will be showcasing their designs.But the biggest show will be taking place in the main pavilion, where the main party is set to go down with several national and local acts such as KO, DJ Bongs and Heavy K set to wow revellers. The idea is to express our heritage through music, fashion and the arts and say to the world this is what the Eastern Cape is all about, said Bara.An area termed the business village will feature no less than 30 food vendors from in and around Berlin and 30 registered SMMEs. This event is a production. From nothing we create a small town and nothing makes me happier than that, said Bara.Bara said the Berlin November event brought massive economic spin-offs to local tourism, which was part of the reason he put so much effort into producing a world-class event. All the labour that we have, not only on the day but building up to the event is local people, he said. From security to catering and other services we have given preference the people of Berlin. Should it rain, went on Bara, prospective revellers should not worry as the planning had been done so that most activities, bar the horse race, takes place indoors. zingisam@dispatch.co.za
